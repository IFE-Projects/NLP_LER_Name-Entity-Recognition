High Pressure Coolant Injection System Inoperable Due to a Lack of Hydraulic Oil Pressure by the Auxiliary Oil Pump.
 At 0140 EST on March 19, 2019, while Unit 2 was at approximately 1 percent power in Mode 2, Operations declared the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) inoperable following a failed Operability test. During the test, the HPCI auxiliary oil pump failed to start when the control switch was taken to start. Due to the lack of hydraulic oil pressure provided by the auxiliary oil pump, the HPCI main stop valve did not open followed by the illumination of the HPCI turbine trip annunciator, thus preventing HPCI from starting and making it inoperable. An investigation was performed and found the secondary connection stabs on the Motor Control Center Pan Assembly feeding the auxiliary oil pump were not making adequate contact. The stab tension was adjusted and the oil pump was started followed by successful completion of the HPCI pump operability test. Because HPCI does not have a redundant system, the pump failure to start on demand represents a safety system functional failure as defined in NEI 99-02 and is reportable per 50 72(b)(3)(v)(D).
