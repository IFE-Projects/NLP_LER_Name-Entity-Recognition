RHR Decay Heat Removal Pump Start Permissive Logic Hardening Error.
 On April 16, 2019 at approximately 0215 with the plant shutdown in Mode 5 with the cavity flooded and fuel pool gates out, 13 Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Pump failed to start from the control room during performance of the RHR System Cold Shutdown Valve Operability Test. Investigation into the failure to start identified that hardening activities on Division 1 of RHR Shutdown Cooling (SDC) conducted on April 13, 2019 resulted in defeating remote start capability of both 11 and 13 RHR pumps. This condition caused the 11 and 13 RHR pumps to be inoperable between April 13 and April 16. With both pumps inoperable, LCOs 3.4.8, 3.9.7 and 3.9.8 were not met and the Required Action for one or two RHR shutdown cooling subsystems inoperable requiring verification of an alternate method of decay heat removal for each inoperable RHR shutdown cooling system within 1 hour and once per 24 hours thereafter was not performed. This condition was determined to be reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), "Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications." There were no actual safety consequences from this condition. The 11 RHR pump was operating in SDC mode for the duration of the condition from when hardening was installed until the hardening error was corrected. At no time during this condition was shutdown cooling lost or not in service controlling reactor water temperature. A low pressure ECCS injection/spray subsystem was operable at all times for the duration of the condition.
