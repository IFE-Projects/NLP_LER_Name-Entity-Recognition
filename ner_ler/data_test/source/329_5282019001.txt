Emergency Core Cooling System Valve Leakage Resulting in an Unanalyzed Condition.
 On March 31, 2019, at approximately 20:06 Mountain Standard Time (MST), PVNGS Unit 1 Shift Manager was informed that leakage at static system pressure from the "A" Train Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) was measured at approximately 100 milliliters per minute through a High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) system drain valve. This value exceeded the Large Break Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) analysis value of 3000 milliliters per hour (mL/hour), pressurized ECCS leakage from sources outside of containment. 

 At 02:30 MST on April 01, 2019, the valve was flushed and the leakage was reduced below the analysis value to 600 mL/hour with the system at static pressure. Troubleshooting efforts continued and the HPSI system drain valve was replaced on April 18, 2018. A pressurized ECCS leak test that was completed on April 23, 2019, confirming zero leakage from the valve. 

 The apparent cause was the connection of ECCS drain valves located outside of containment to an open-ended drain header that does not limit the potential radiological consequences of seat leakage. A design change is planned to install pipe caps on HPSI system drain valves. 

 No similar conditions have been reported by PVNGS in the past three years.
