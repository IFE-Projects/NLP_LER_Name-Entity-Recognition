Unrecognized Inoperability of Boron Dilution Mitigation System (BDMS) Train 'B'.
 On August 23, 2019, it was discovered that Flux Doubling Test Bypass Switch S604 had failed to close when it was placed in its Normal position at 1543 on May 10, 2019. This failure would have prevented train 'B' of the Boron Dilution Mitigation System from performing its required safety function when required to be Operable in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.9, "Boron Dilution Mitigation System (BDMS)," for the periods from 1543 on May 10, 2019 to 2259 on May 16, 2019, and from 2301 on May 16, 2019 to 1212 on May 17, 2019. Due to the unrecognized inoperability of BDMS train 'B', the TS 3.3.9 Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) requiring two trains of BDMS to be Operable was not met during these periods, and the applicable Required Actions were not completed within their specified Completion Times. In addition, Mode changes were performed during these periods of BDMS train 'B' inoperability without satisfying the provisions of TS LCO 3.0.4.a, thereby resulting in a violation of TS LCO 3.0.4. Following discovery of the failure on August 23, 2019, remedial actions were taken to close the affected switch in its Normal position.

 Failure of the switch contacts to close on May 10, 2019 has been attributed to either a stack misalignment or mechanical binding. Corrective actions to prevent recurrence include establishing requirements to verify continuity through the Flux Double Test Bypass Switches for both BDMS trains when the switches are manipulated, and to replace the affected switch at the next available opportunity.
