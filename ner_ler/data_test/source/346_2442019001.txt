Air Leakage from Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feed Pump Lube Oil Accumulator Results in Unexpected Pump Inoperability.
 On 3/7/2019, during the performance of quarterly surveillance testing, the Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (TDAFW) pump was unexpectedly found to be inoperable due to low lube oil (LO) accumulator air precharge pressure. After securing the AC LO pump to test the automatic start of the DC LO pump, the trip throttle valve unexpectedly tripped closed due to low lube oil pressure. The LO accumulator functions to maintain adequate LO pressure during LO pump perturbations. The TDAFW Pump was not in operation when the trip throttle valve unlatched and closed, therefore there was no impact on plant operation. 

 The most probable cause is that the TDAFW Pump LO accumulator air precharge pressure was lower than expected due to leakage from the air charging valve. Additionally, an acceptance criteria for LO accumulator air precharge pressure leakage, to ensure the accumulator function was maintained, had not been established. The Accumulator was precharged to the required pressure and a successful re-test was performed. Corrective actions are planned to establish LO accumulator air precharge pressure leakage acceptance criteria and a system modification to install an air charging valve manual isolation valve.

 Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.5.C requires the TDAFW pump to be operable. Due to inability to determine exact time of inoperability, it was conservatively assumed to be inoperable for greater than the TS allowed time of 72 hours, which requires a report to the NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS.
