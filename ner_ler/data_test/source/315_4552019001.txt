Plant: Byron 2.
Manual Actuation of Auxiliary Feedwater due to High Inboard Motor Bearing Temperature on Startup Feedwater Pump.
 On April 22, 2019 at 0850 hours, the non-safety related Start Up Feedwater (SUFW) pump [SJ] was started in support of plant heat up per Byron procedure 2BGP 100-1, "Plant Heatup". Engineering was performing monitoring and identified that the inboard motor bearing temperature of the SUFW pump was elevated and continuing to rise. Operations was notified and continued to monitor the bearing temperature in parallel with Engineering monitoring. At 1300 hours, the bearing reached 208 degrees F and the SUFW pump was secured to prevent damage to the motor. During this time, Operations was not able to begin the startup process for the non-safety related Motor Driven Feedwater (MDFW) pump because it was not filled and vented. Therefore, upon securing the SUFW pump, Operations entered Byron procedure 2BOA SEC-1, "Secondary Pump Trip" and performed the appropriate attachment for loss of Feedwater flow in Mode 3. The attachment required Operations to start an Auxiliary Feedwater (AF) [BA] pump. The motor driven AF pump [AFW Train A] was manually started at 1323 hours on April 22, 2019 and supplied water to the Steam Generators as designed. This resulted in ENS 54020 for manual actuation of the AF system. Filling and venting of the MDFW pump were completed and the pump was started at 1626 hours, allowing the motor driven AF pump to be shut down at 1632 hours on April 22, 2019.
