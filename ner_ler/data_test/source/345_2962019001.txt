Plant: Browns Ferry 3.
Automatic Reactor Scram due to a Turbine Load Reject.
 On March 9, 2019, at approximately 2259 Central Standard Time (CST), Browns Ferry Unit 3 received an automatic Reactor SCRAM from 100 percent power as a result of a Turbine Load Reject. Browns Ferry Unit 3 declared a Notification of Unusual Event due to loss of the 500kV offsite source. The automatic SCRAM occurred as a Licensed Reactor Operator (LRO) made adjustments to lower incoming reactive power on Unit 3 at the request of the Balancing Authority. The LRO incorrectly operated a hand switch and changed the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) from auto to manual. In this mode of operation, the dynamic limiter is removed, which allows Operations personnel to adjust Mega Volt Amps Reactive (MVAR) beyond the Under Excitation Limiter (UEL) protection setting. As a result, the generator circuit breaker tripped causing a Turbine Load reject and an automatic SCRAM. All safety systems actuated as designed. 

 The root cause for this event was determined to be that Operations department leaders have allowed continued negative human performance (HU) behaviors by inconsistently providing coaching or reinforcing the use of appropriate HU barriers. The corrective action to prevent recurrence is to revise the Operations Excellence Program, BFN-ODM-4.28, to require use of a dynamic learning environment to develop Operations Department Leaders' skills in coaching and reinforcing the use of appropriate HU barriers. Training will be required prior to assuming shift following initial qualification as Nuclear Unit Senior Operators (NUSO) and Shift Managers (SM). The currently qualified NUSOs and SMs have received training. 

 A plastic cover was placed over the manual/auto select voltage regulator hand switch on all three Units to mitigate unintentional operation of the AVR from automatic to manual control. The Operating Instruction procedure for the Turbine Generator System was revised to prompt Operations personnel to validate the initial status of the AVR prior to adjusting MVAR.
