Turbine Control System Auto-Stop Trip Solenoid Operated Valves Response Times Impacted.
 On April 16-17, 2019, the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, attempted to perform turbine trip testing of each individual solenoid operated valve (SOV) within the Auto-Stop Trip (AST) and Overspeed Protection Control (OPC) Quadvoter Trip Block assemblies. The response received on April 16th for the first AST Quadvoter SOV indicated that the valve was unable to cycle. Troubleshooting efforts were successful in restoring functionality of the valve. The redundant SOV in the A channel tested satisfactorily. On April 17th, testing of the B channel was completed and the first SOV tested failed similarly to the first A channel valve. Troubleshooting efforts were successful in restoring functionality and preemptively applied to the second SOV in the B channel. Based on the test results, it is likely that both channels of the system were non-functional at the same time. With both AST channels rendered non-functional, the system was incapable of depressurizing the AST hydraulic header to trip the main turbine within the time response requirements of Technical Specifications. The root cause of this event is that the vendor design of the Quadvoter utilized spool-type pilot SOVs without adequately addressing inherent design vulnerabilities in a Fyrquel fluid application to ensure consistent, reliable operation of the trip and reset functions. Immediate action was taken to increase the frequency of AST valve testing and to increase the cycling of the solenoid valves for each test. Pilot valve springs were replaced with a stronger spring in all AST valves. Planned corrective actions include a design change to reduce the sensitivity of the pilot SOVs to the determined failure mechanisms and the flushing of AST and OPC Quadvoter Trip Block assemblies.
