Plant: Catawba 1.
Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications and Loss of Safety Function due to Auxiliary Feedwater Sump Pump Conditions.
 On April 11, 2019, the 1B Motor Driven (MD) Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) sump pump failed to start in manual and was nonoperational. The pump impeller was found seized. The 1B MDAFW sump pump was repaired and returned to service on May 1, 2019.

 A new Auxiliary Building flooding calculation subsequently has shown that, in the event of a feedwater line break in the interior doghouse coincident with a loss of offsite power, the sump pumps for all three trains of the AFW pumps are required to remain functional. Taking into consideration the specified function of the AFW sump pumps, the 1B MDAFW pump should have been declared inoperable for the corresponding times that the sump pump was out of service. Therefore, the 1B MDAFW pump was inoperable for a period longer than the allowed Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO). 

 An extent of condition review identified two additional instances between April 11, 2019, and April 18, 2019, where two trains of AFW were inoperable due to the associated non-functional sump pumps and/or MDAFW pump inoperability for a period longer than the allowed TS LCO. Furthermore, the review identified one instance on January 19, 2019, where a test procedure resulted in all associated Unit 1 AFW sump pumps discharge valves being closed which resulted in a condition prohibited by the TS LCO and a loss of safety function. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.
