Plant: Vogtle 2.
Spurious Closure of Main Steam Isolation Valve results in Manual Reactor Trip.
 On March 30, 2019 at 2130, while Unit 2 was in Mode 1 and 30 percent power, exiting a refueling outage, when one of the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV) failed closed unexpectedly. This resulted in an inability to maintain Steam Generator (SG) levels and pressures. The unit was manually tripped. All systems responded as designed. All control rods fully inserted into the core, auxiliary feedwater was started, and decay heat was removed through the main steam lines through the steam dumps and into the condenser. The plant was stabilized in Mode 3. Due to the manual actuation of systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B), specifically the Reactor Protection System and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, this event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). Because all systems responded as designed and had no adverse effects on the health and safety of the public, this event is of very low safety significance.
