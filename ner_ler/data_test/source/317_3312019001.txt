Plant: Duane Arnold.
Manual Reactor Scram due to Lowering Reactor Water Level.
 On April 20, 2019, while operating at 100% power, NextEra Energy Duane Arnold (DAEC) experienced a trip of both reactor feed pumps due to a loss of suction pressure. As a result, plant operators inserted a manual scram. All control rods inserted, as required. As a result of the feed pump trips and scram, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically injected. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50.72 section 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A) - ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) - RPS Actuation - Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) - Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54012). The root cause of this event was brittle fracture of a condensate demineralizer in-line air filter bowl due to heat related age degradation. This event was of very low safety significance and had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event and none that contributed to the event. This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). In addition to the event that occurred on April 20, 2019, this LER is reporting a related event that occurred on April 21, 2019 that resulted in an invalid Primary Containment Isolation System. There were no radiological releases associated with either of these event.
