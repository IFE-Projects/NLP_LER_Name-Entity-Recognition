Control Room Emergency Ventilation System Inoperable due to Main Control Room Door Being Left Open.
 At 0232 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on April 23, 2019, a Main Control Room (MCR) alarm was received for low control room positive pressure. At 0233 EDT, a Control Room Envelope (CRE) door was found ajar and immediately closed. Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.10, Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS), was declared not met for both trains and Condition B entered. At 0233 EDT on April 23, 2019, the alarm cleared, CREVS was declared operable and LCO 3.7.10, Condition B was exited. 

 This event was caused by a human performance error when an individual traversing the control building complex failed to confirm the MCR envelope boundary door was properly latched. The open control room door was identified and promptly closed. The individual involved was coached on the requirement to challenge the door when traversing the control building complex. Work orders to install engineering features on MCR doors to ensure they are closed after opening were completed after this event occurred.

 This condition is being reported as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).
