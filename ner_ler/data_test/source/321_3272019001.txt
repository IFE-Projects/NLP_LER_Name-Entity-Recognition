Plant: Sequoyah 1.
Reactor Trip on Low-Low Steam Generator Level due to the Loss of a Main Feedwater Pump.
 On April 14, 2019, at 0320 eastern daylight time (EDT), Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, experienced an automatic reactor trip. The reactor trip was preceded by a turbine runback, because main feedwater pump (MFP) 1A tripped on low lube oil pressure. In response to the 1A MFP trip, the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System actuated, as designed; however, AFW and the remaining main feedwater pump (1B) were not able to provide sufficient feedwater flow to maintain steam generator level. This resulted in an automatic reactor trip due to low-low level in the Loop 3 steam generator (SG). The causes of the reactor trip were previous MFP turbine hydraulic control system modifications coupled with an unvalidated turbine runback setpoint resulting in the inability to supply adequate feedwater flow to the SGs during the loss of a MFP transient. The corrective actions to prevent recurrence are: (1) implement digital feed pump control upgrade via an engineering change package, and (2) implement a revised turbine runback setpoint, as determined, as part of an engineering change package.
