Unit 2 Scram due to Main Turbine Low Oil Pressure Trip.
 On May 9, 2019, at 0348 CDT, Unit 2 received an automatic reactor scram as the result of the main turbine tripping due to low oil pressure from the main shaft oil pump. Following the scram, all systems operated as expected, decay heat was being removed using the steam bypass valves to the condenser, and the safety relief valves did not lift. Inspection of the main turbine front standard and main oil pump revealed damage to the spline interface between the main gear quill shaft and the high-pressure control rotor. This damage led to a loss of power transfer between the main turbine and the main oil pump which supplies bearing header pressure. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section." The automatic actuation of the reactor protection system is listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). The cause of the event was determined to be work order instructions contained an unrecognized critical activity that lacked the detail needed to prevent human error during installation of quill shaft oil gasket. Corrective actions include updating the model work orders for turbine front standard maintenance to include the proper level of detail and establishing new post-maintenance testing practices.
