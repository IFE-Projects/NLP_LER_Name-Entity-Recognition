Automatic Actuation of the Primary Containment Isolation System.
 At 05:35 EST on March 5, 2019, with Unit 2 in Mode 5 at 0% power, an actuation of the Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS) occurred during hydro-lasing of the reactor water level variable leg instrumentation line nozzle N011B in the reactor cavity. The hydrolasing activity caused low reactor water level to be sensed on the shutdown range level instrumentation. Per design, the low level 1 signal resulted in Group 2 (e.g., floor and equipment drain isolation valves), Group 6 (e.g., monitoring and sampling isolation valves) and Group 8 (e.g., shutdown cooling isolation valves) isolations.This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a valid actuation of PCIS.

 This event resulted from the failure to properly assess risk and put compensatory actions in place when planning the hydro-lasing activity on the N011B nozzle. There was no adverse impact on the health and safety of the public. Although there was a brief interruption of shutdown cooling, the Alternate Decay Heat Removal (ADHR) System was in service and the Reactor Cavity was flooded up. Since decay heat load was within the capacity of the ADHR system, there was no loss of Decay Heat Removal capability. The Group 8 isolation was reset and shutdown cooling was restored within approximately 10 minutes. The safety significance of this event was minimal.
