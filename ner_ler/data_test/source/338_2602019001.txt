Traversing In-core Probe Purge Header Check Valve Leak Rate in Excess of Technical Specifications Limits.
 On March 23, 2019, at approximately 1600 Central Daylight Time (CDT), while performing surveillance testing required prior to initial startup from the Unit 2 Refueling Outage, Local Leak Rate Testing (LLRT) identified the failure of a Primary Containment penetration for the Traversing ln-core Probe (TIP) system. Further troubleshooting determined that the TIP Purge Header check valve was leaking by, rendering the test volume unable to be pressurized. The gross leakage Leak Rate value exceeded the Technical Specification allowable value for Type C valves of less than 60 percent of the allowable limit. On March 26, 2019, at approximately 1030 CDT, Engineering evaluation determined that the TIP System leakage test results related to LLRT of the TIP Purge Header Check Valve resulted in a reportable condition. At 1508 CDT, Event Notification 53959 was made to the NRC for a serious degradation of the reactorâ€™s principle safety barriers. 

 The apparent cause of this event was foreign material in the body of the TIP Purge Header check valve which prevented the valve from seating. The immediate corrective action for this condition was to replace the failed valve. An additional corrective action will be implemented to add another check valve in series for penetrations affected by this condition to allow dual barrier containment isolation for Units 1, 2, and 3.
