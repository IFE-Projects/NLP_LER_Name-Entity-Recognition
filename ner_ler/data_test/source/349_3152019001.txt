Plant: Cook 1.
Two Main Steam Safety Valve Setpoints Found Outside Technical Specification Limits.
 On March 4, 2019, Donald C. Cook Unit 1 was in Mode 1 and holding at approximately 49% reactor power while performing Technical Specification (TS) surveillance testing on the Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs) setpoints, just prior to the Unit 1 Cycle 29 (U1C29) Refueling Outage.

 The Unit 1 Steam Generator (SG) #2 MSSVs 1-SV-1B-2 and 1-SV-2A-2 as found setpoints were above the TS allowable setpoint pressure of +/- 3% lift setpoint pressure. 

 Based on the guidance in NUREG-1022, Revision 3, the Unit 1 SG #2 MSSVs were considered to be inoperable longer than allowed by TS. 

 The cause of the failure was determined to be setpoint drift. The MSSV setpoints were adjusted and, after adjustment, the MSSVs passed the as left testing criteria of +/- 1% lift setpoint pressure. Since a similar cause was determined for both unsatisfactory as found lift pressures, this condition may have arisen over a period of time, and there is a likelihood that the affected MSSVs may not have been operable during plant operation. 

 Therefore, this event is reportable as an Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).
