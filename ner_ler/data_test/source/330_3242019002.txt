Manual Reactor Protection System Actuation and Specified System Actuation.
 At 17:47 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 30, 2019, with Unit 2 in Mode 1 at approximately 23 percent power and main turbine startup in progress, high temperature was sensed at main turbine bearing 9. A manual main turbine trip and manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) were initiated in response to the high bearing temperature. All control rods inserted as expected during the scram. When the scram was inserted, reactor water level dropped below the Low Level 1 (LL1) actuation setpoint. Per design, the LL1 signal resulted in automatic actuation of the Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS) with closure of Group 2, 6, and 8 isolation valves. Operators manually closed the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs), in anticipation of low condenser vacuum, prior to the Group 1 PCIS signal being received. All systems responded as designed. This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in valid actuations of RPS and PCIS. 

 The direct cause of this event was insufficient lubricating oil supply to the main turbine bearing 9 which caused the bearing to overheat; leading to the manual scram. The most probable cause for the insufficient oil flow was design differences which resulted in a misalignment between the lower half bearing flow channel and the oil supply port in the main turbine 9 bearing housing. Corrective actions include a procedure change to ensure that lubricating oil supply oil flow is not restricted as a result of bearing replacement.
