Manual Reactor Scram from 25 Percent Power Due to Loss of Condenser Vacuum.
 On March 24, 2019 at 0026, with Unit 2 in Mode 1 and ascending in power, Control Room Operators noticed the Main Condenser was losing vacuum and initiated a power reduction. Due to vacuum continuing to degrade, Operators lowered reactor power down to 25 percent and initiated a manual reactor SCRAM at 0159. Following the trip of the Main Turbine, the non-safety Station Service 4160V buses failed to fast bus transfer from normal to the alternate power supply resulting in the loss of all non-safety loads. Operators entered an abnormal operating procedure for the Loss of 4160V buses to manually re-energize the Station Service buses. The de-energized Station Service buses resulted in a loss of the Condensate Feedwater system. Reactor water level was then maintained by the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling system while pressure was controlled by High Pressure Coolant Injection. A primary containment isolation signal was received on low reactor water level. The event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for a manual reactor SCRAM and general containment isolation signal.

 Corrective actions were taken to properly align the Steam Jet Air Ejector system, which was the cause of the loss of condenser vacuum, and to replace the failed relay, which caused the failure of the Station Service buses to transfer.
