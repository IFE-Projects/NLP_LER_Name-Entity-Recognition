Plant: Waterford 3.
Boron Dilution Alarm (Startup Channel High Neutron Flux) Inoperable Resulting in Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On March 10, 2019, at 2310 Central Daylight Time (CDT), Startup Channel 1 was declared inoperable due to discovery that it was de-energized. Technical Specification (TS) 3.1.2.9, "Boron Dilution," was entered. It was determined that this condition originated during the previous shift, when the Plant Protection System (PPS) Channel 'C' Functional Test was performed. Per the test, Startup Channel 1 was selected to 'Alternate,' resulting in it being automatically de-energized based on the indicated value of Log Power Channel 'D', which had been previously declared inoperable due to erratic behavior. The condition went undetected until discovery, resulting in an event or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. Operability was restored to Startup Channel 1 and TS 3.1.2.9 was exited at on March 10, 2019 at 2318 CDT. 

 The cause of this event was there was no guidance in the surveillance procedure to verify the operability of the associated Log Power Channel prior to performing the test. Action to revise the procedure to require verification of operability has been completed.
