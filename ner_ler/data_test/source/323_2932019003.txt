Plant: Pilgrim.
Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications Involving the Mechanical Vacuum Pump.
 On April 13, 2019, the operating crew placed the key lock switch for Main Steam Process Radiation Monitor (PRM) 1705-2D to the INOP position and restored the Mechanical Vacuum (MV) pump to ready state. Subsequent research into the INOP position for the PRM 1705-2D switch revealed that this action does not introduce a channel trip signal. Not placing the PRM in a trip condition with the MV pump restored to ready state, is a violation of Technical Specification Action Statement 3.8.2.A.2 to place the channel or associated trip system in trip within 24 hours. 

 There were no actual consequences to safety of the general public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, or radiological safety for this event.
