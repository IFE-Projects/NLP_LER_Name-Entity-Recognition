Turbine Stop Valve Limit Switch Failure due to Insufficient Lubrication.
 On March 23, 2019, during quarterly scram functional surveillances of turbine stop valves (TSV), the limit switch associated with TSV number 3 failed to return to shelf state when the lever arm was released. The failed component was replaced and sent offsite for component testing and failure analysis. The component failure analysis completed on May 3, 2019 determined the cause was attributed to insufficient lubrication in the shaft to bushing section of the limit switch. This established firm evidence that the failure mechanism and past inoperability condition may have existed since its last successful surveillance on December 15, 2018.

 The affected component 1C71-N006C is the TSV-3 Closure RPS channel A2 scram limit switch. This device is required by Technical Specifications to support LCO 3.3.1.1 function 8 (RPS) and LCO 3.3.4.1 (EOC-RPT). Each TSV position is monitored by two limit switches (for TSV-3, A2 and B1 channels). This condition resulted in the TSV-3 input to RPS A2 as well as one channel of the EOC-RPT trip being INOPERABLE. The appropriate LCO Conditions and Required Actions were entered and tracked. The RPS and EOC-RPT functions were maintained due to the redundant channels remaining OPERABLE. There were no reportability thresholds applicable to this issue at the time of the event, and there was no loss of safety function. The condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) for operation or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.

 Immediate corrective actions were taken to replace the component and restore the associated channel to OPERABLE. Additional actions included performance of a component failure analysis and to complete scheduled limit switch replacements of the current model with a new limit switch model that has greater heat tolerance.
