Three Main Steam Safety Valves Failed Inservice Test Program As-Found Lift Acceptance Criteria.
 On February 26 and 27, 2020, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 74 percent power, setpoint testing determined three of the Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs) had a setpoint more than three percent below the desired setpoint. These setpoints exceeded the Inservice Test Program allowable value, rendering the valves inoperable in accordance with the Technical Specifications. The setpoint of each MSSV was adjusted as necessary to within one percent of the desired setpoint upon discovery. Based on the low as-found lift setting pressures, the ability of the MSSVs to provide overpressure protection for the secondary system was not adversely impacted. 

 The most probable cause of the low lift setting was determined to be setpoint drift, possibly due to spring aging. The two MSSVs with the largest setpoint variance will be removed during the next refueling outage and replaced with qualified spares, and the removed valves will be then be inspected, rebuilt, and tested, including performance of spring rate testing to determine if spring replacement is warranted. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by the Technical Specifications.
