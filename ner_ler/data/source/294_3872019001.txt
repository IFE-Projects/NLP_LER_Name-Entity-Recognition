Loss of Both Control Structure Chillers due to Misaligned Breaker Stab.
 On May 22, 2019, at 0240, the A Control Structure (CS) Chiller tripped due to a loss of power to Motor Control Center (MCC) 0B136. At the time of the trip, the B CS Chiller was out of service for planned maintenance on the Emergency Service Water (ESW) System. The CS Chillers are required to be operable by Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) 3.7.3, “Control Room Emergency Outside Air Supply (CREOAS) System” and 3.7.4, “Control Room Floor Cooling System.” The CREOAS and Control Room Floor Cooling systems provide cooling and ventilation to various safety-related loads including the control room, computer room, relay rooms, and emergency switchgear rooms. The loss of both chillers required entry in LCOs 3.7.3, 3.7.4, and 3.0.3, thereby requiring the commencement of a dual unit shutdown. As a result, this event was reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v) as a condition which could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i) for the initiation of a plant shutdown required by TS. The power reduction was halted upon restoration of the A CS Chiller. The condition was also determined to be reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function. 

 The direct cause was determined to be inadequate engagement of cubicle stabs. The root cause was determined to be vendor design differences in cubicle stab assemblies introduced during replacement of original plant equipment. Corrective actions include removing the misaligned breaker stab from service and de-energizing, cleaning, and inspecting MCC 0B136.

 There were no actual safety consequences associated with the condition.
