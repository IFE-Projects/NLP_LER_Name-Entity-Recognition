Reactor Trip due to Turbine Trip on Low Condenser Vacuum.
 At 15:50 on 4/13/2020, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 (MPS3) operating at approximately 82% reactor power, an automatic reactor trip occurred following a turbine trip due to low condenser vacuum. Severe environmental conditions resulted in significant debris impingement on the travelling screens, and clogging of the screenwash system strainers, leading to both screenwash pumps tripping, high travelling screen level differential and the trip of two circulating water pumps. The loss of two circulating water pumps resulted in a rapidly degrading condenser vacuum and a turbine trip on low condenser vacuum. The Auxiliary Feedwater System actuated as designed following the trip. The low condenser vacuum trip was caused by rapidly degrading environmental conditions that overcame the capacity of the screen wash system leading to a trip of both screen wash pumps and two circulating water pumps. The screen wash system strainers were cleaned, and the screen wash system and travelling screens were returned to service. All circulating water pumps were restored, and condenser vacuum reestablished at 14:10 on 4/14/2020. The actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) is being reported in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of systems listed in 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B).
