Plant: Peach Bottom 2.
High Pressure Coolant Injection System Declared Inoperable Due to Instrument Power Inverter Failure.
 On April 29, 2021 at 2354 ET with Unit 2 plant operating conditions at 100% rated thermal power, the "High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) system inverter circuit failure" alarm was received on a Main Control Room panel. This alarm indicates a loss of AC power from the HPCI inverter, and is caused by either a loss of DC power to, or a failure of, the inverter. Operations personnel immediately noticed the erratic performance of HPCI system instruments, digital recorders, and a loss of expected status display on the HPCI flow controller. Subsequent investigation into the HPCI inverter circuit failure alarm revealed the inverter was cycling on and off. In the event of a valid HPCI initiation signal, the erratic loss of power to the HPCI flow controller would have resulted in a loss of HPCI function. On April 30, 2021 at 0023 ET Operations personnel declared HPCI inoperable. At 0023 ET, at the direction of Shift supervision, the inverter power supply fuses were removed to arrest the inverter cycling on and off. The HPCI inverter was subsequently removed from service, replaced in kind, and then tested satisfactorily. 

 The loss of the HPCI function was due to the inverter failure. There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event. This report is made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) for an event or condition that at the time of discovery could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
