Plant: Surry 1.
Items Non-Conforming to Design for Tornado Missile Protection.
 On December 11, 2019, Surry Nuclear Power Plant determined that the certain Unit 1 and 2 Class 1 Structures, Systems, and Components (SSCs) did not conform with the licensing basis for protection against a design basis tornado generated missile.

 The affected equipment was declared inoperable and enforcement discretion invoked in accordance with NRC Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 15-002, Rev. 1, "Enforcement Discretion for Tornado Missile Protection Noncompliance." Initial compensatory measures were implemented pursuant to the guidance of NRC Interim Staff Guidance DSS-ISG-2016-01, Appendix A, within the time allowed by the applicable Limiting Conditions for Operation and the associated systems were then declared operable, but nonconforming. 

 Since the condition was part of the original plant design and licensing of the station, there was no specific cause identified.

 There were no safety consequences as a result of this event. Actions are underway to address the condition.
