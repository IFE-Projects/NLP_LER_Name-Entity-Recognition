Simultaneous Inoperability of Main Control Room Ventilation Subsystems A and B.
 The Main Control Room (MCR) Ventilation and Air Conditioning System (VC) subsystem A was removed from service for planned maintenance and declared inoperable on 11/16/20. At 1918 on 11/16/20, MCR VC subsystem B supply air isolation dampers 0VC21YB, 0VC24YB and 0VC27YB lost power and failed closed. Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.3. Control Room Ventilation System, Action F.1 and TS 3.7.4, Control Room AC System, Actions B.1 and B.2 were entered. VC subsystem A ventilation was restored to OPERABLE status and at 2036, TS 3.7.3 Action F.1 was exited. At 0350 on 11/17/20, VC subsystem A chiller was restored to OPERABLE status and TS 3.7.4 Actions B.1 and B.2 were exited. Investigation determined that a shorted coil in breaker cubicle 0AP25E-4B motor starter caused fuse 0AP25E4A-F01 to blow, which resulted in dampers 0VC21YB, 0VC24YB and 0VC27YB losing power and failing closed. The failed motor starter coil and fuse were replaced and successfully tested. The condition where both required VC subsystems were simultaneously inoperable is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. However, there was no impact to the health and safety of the public or plant personnel, as subsequent post-maintenance testing demonstrated VC subsystem A remained capable of performing its safety functions throughout the event.
