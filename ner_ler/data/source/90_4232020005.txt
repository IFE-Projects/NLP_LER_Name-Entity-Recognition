Plant: Millstone 3.
Loss of Safety Function - Secondary Containment.
 On October 2, 2020, at 9:45, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 (MPS3) in Mode 4, at approximately 230 degrees Fahrenheit, a security door in the Secondary Containment was identified as blocked open rendering Secondary Containment inoperable. Investigation determined that the door had been blocked open on October 1, 2020, at 18:42. The door was closed by Operations on October 2, 2020, at 9:55. An 8-hour report was made to the NRC pursuant to the requirements of 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(C) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D) reporting the event as condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems needed to control the release of a radioactive material, and mitigate the consequences of an accident. The cause was identified to be a weakness in the process of notifying the Control Room prior to blocking open a door as it is not fully bounded by procedures and lacks clear ownership. Operations closed the door, which restored the Secondary Containment to operable status. There were no safety consequences to the public or the environment related to this event. 

 This event is being reported as a 60-day LER in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) reporting an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to control the release of a radioactive material and mitigate the consequences of an accident.
