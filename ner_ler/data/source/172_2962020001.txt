Automatic Actuation of Emergency Diesel Generators due to an Offsite Lightning Strike.
 On March 3, 2020, at approximately 0416 Central Standard Time, there was a partial loss of 161 kV power due to a trip and re-closure of the feeder breaker supplying the Common Station Service Transformer (CSST) A. BFN, Unit 3 lost power to the 1A Start Bus and the 3A Unit Board, which supplies power to the 3EA and 3EB 4 kV Shutdown Boards (SD BDs). The loss of the 4 kV SD BDs resulted in an auto actuation of the 3A and 3B Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs). The 3C EDG and 3EC 4 kV SD BD were removed from service for maintenance at the time of the loss of power, and the 3ED 4 kV SD BD continued to be powered from the 3B Unit Board. 

 The apparent cause of this event was determined to be an off-site lightning strike to the Athens 161 kV line, which actuated 161 kV line breakers 924 and 928. These breakers opened and reclosed to clear the high short circuit current (phase differential) sensed on the line by zone protection relays. This caused other downstream breakers to open, and subsequently resulted in the loss of power to Unit 3 4 kV Shutdown Boards 3EA & 3EB. The system responses which occurred are consistent with the normal operation and design of protective breakers. No equipment failure was identified, so no corrective actions were required. However, BFN will perform a feasibility study to determine if hardening of the 161 kV power system protection scheme can be performed to decrease impact of a lightning strike or fault on the 161 kV transmission lines while still maintaining the necessary protection and coordination for the 161 kV system and 4 kV start buses.
