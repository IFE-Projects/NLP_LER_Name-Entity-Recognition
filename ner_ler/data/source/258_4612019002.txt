Turbine Driven Reactor Feed Pump Hydraulic Control Failure Results in Automatic SCRAM.
 On August 3, 2019, at 0226 CDT, while operating at approximately 98% power, the Turbine Driven Reactor Feed Pump (TDRFP) B horizontal hardware connection to the Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) failed causing loss of feedback to the feedwater control system. Flow from TDRFP B decreased while TDRFP A flow increased and reactor level decreased to the scram setpoint, which caused an automatic Reactor Protection System (RPS) scram. All control rods fully inserted. The reactor water Level 2 setpoint was reached and High Pressure Core Spray (HPCS), Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC), Division 3 diesel generator, Standby Gas Treatment Systems A and B, and all safety related shutdown service water pumps started as expected. RCIC and HPCS injected as expected. All Level 2 containment isolation valves closed as expected. As a result of automatic isolation of the containment ventilation system, the Primary Containment to Secondary Containment and the Drywell to Primary Containment differential pressure limits were exceeded. The cause of the event was the design of the horizontal connecting hardware to the TDRFP B operating cylinder position LVDT was not adequate to withstand cyclic loading. The failed LVDT was replaced on TDRFP B, along with associated horizontal connecting hardware. A design change will be developed and installed to strengthen the connecting hardware to the TDRFP B operating-cylinder LVDT such that it is adequate to withstand cyclic loading. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B), and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C).
