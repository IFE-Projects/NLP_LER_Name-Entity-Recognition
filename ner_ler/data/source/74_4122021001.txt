Plant: Beaver Valley 2.
Operation Prohibited by Technical Specifications During a Loss of Control Rod Position Indication Event.
 On January 4, 2021 at 1752 hours, while operating at approximately 100% power, Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) non-safety 480V Bus 2E de-energized due to the supply breaker having tripped due to a degraded overcurrent device. This resulted in the loss of both trains of Digital Rod Position Indication (DRPI), as well as three of the five movable incore detectors. BVPS-2 declared both trains of DRPI inoperable and entered Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.1.7.2 Condition B, more than one DRPI per group inoperable in one or more groups. It was later determined that Condition A also applied but was not entered at the time of the event. This Condition in part would have required a reduction to </= 50% rated thermal power (RTP) within 8 hours, and if not met Condition E would have required the plant to be in Mode 3 within the next 6 hours. Power was restored to the bus and both trains of DRPI were declared OPERABLE after 14 hours 13 minutes. This resulted in operation prohibited by TS reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). 

 The direct cause was the Shift Manager failed to enter and apply the Required Actions for LCO 3.1.7.2 Condition A. The root cause was that changes implemented by station personnel for NRC approved changes to LCO 3.1.7.2 introduced conflicting guidance between the TS and guidance documentation. Corrective actions include revising the TS Bases and the operating procedure to remove the conflicting guidance.
