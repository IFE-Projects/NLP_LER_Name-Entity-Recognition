Emergency Diesel Generator Inoperable due to Temperature Control Valve Failure.
 On August 19, 2019, at 0223 Central Daylight Time (CDT), during performance of its monthly operability run, the 'A' Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) was declared inoperable due to high intercooler water temperature. Condition B of Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.8.1, "AC Sources - Operating" was entered at this time. At the time of the event, the unit was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power.

 Investigation revealed that the reason for the high intercooler water temperature was the failure of the thermostatic "power pills" in the intercooler heat exchanger temperature control valve. The failed power pills caused the valve to fail in the bypass position, thereby reducing cooling flow through the intercooler heat exchanger. It was determined that the power pills most likely failed prematurely due to accelerated aging induced by annual shelf life testing. Due to the probable cause of failure, there is firm evidence that the condition existed following the previous successful run of the 'A' EDG on July 15, 2019, which is longer than the 72-hour completion time required by TS LCO 3.8.1. In addition, the 'B' EDG was out of service for maintenance for approximately 2 days during this period, so this was also a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function.

 The failed power pills were replaced and the 'A' EDG was returned to service on August 20, 2019, at 0500 CDT. Condition B of TS LCO 3.8.1 was exited at this time. There was no impact to the health and safety of the public as a result of this event.
