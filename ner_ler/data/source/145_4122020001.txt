Plant: Beaver Valley 2.
Unacceptable Indication Identified During Reactor Vessel Head Inspection.
 On April 24, 2020 during the Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) twenty-first refueling outage (2R21), the results of ultrasonic examinations performed on Penetration 37 of the reactor vessel head did not meet the applicable acceptance criteria. The indication was not through wall and there was no evidence of leakage at this penetration based on inspections performed on top of the reactor vessel head. Because this indication could not be dispositioned as acceptable per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code Section XI in a Reactor Coolant System pressure boundary, it was reported per Event Notification 54680 as a degraded condition per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) and is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A). 

 Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) of the Alloy 600 penetration tube material was determined to be the cause of the identified flaw. Reactor vessel head Penetration 37 was repaired in accordance with the applicable embedded flaw repair methodology approved by the NRC for use at BVPS-2. A weld overlay of PWSCC resistant material was performed to isolate the indication from the borated water. The safety significance of this indication was very low.
