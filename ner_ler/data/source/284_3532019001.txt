Plant: Limerick 2.
Valid Actuation of the Reactor Protection System due to a Trip of D214-24 Load Center.
 On June 3, 2019, with Limerick Unit 2 at approximately 100% power, the D214-24 Load Center tripped due to an invalid undervoltage signal; resulting in de-energization of a 480 VAC Divisional Motor Control Center (MCC) D214-G-D. The power failure impacted several components in the Offgas System resulting in water building up in the system and causing stalling of the Steam Jet Air Ejectors and a resultant degradation of Main Condenser vacuum. At 01:45 June 4, Operators inserted a manual SCRAM due to Main Condenser vacuum approaching the Main Turbine trip setpoint. The cause of the event is the procedure used to stabilize the plant did not fully address the loss of power to the Offgas System. The corrective action is to revise the procedures used to stabilize the plant to address the loss of power to the Offgas System.
