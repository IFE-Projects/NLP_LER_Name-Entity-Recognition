Pressurizer Heater Sleeve Weld Pressure Boundary Leakage Caused by Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking.
 On the night of March 2, 2021, while Unit 2 was in a refueling outage, an inactive boric acid leak was discovered at the pressurizer heater sleeve penetration G1 weld during a bare metal examination. On March 4, an evaluation confirmed the leak was a through-wall pressure boundary leak. The leak most likely existed during plant operation. All of the Unit 2 pressurizer heater sleeves were originally made of Alloy 600 material and were replaced in 1990. The replacement design consisted of a dual sleeve configuration made of Alloy 690 material, which is more resistant to stress corrosion cracking than the Alloy 600 material. Examinations performed during the 2021 refueling outage concluded that this leak at the G1 location was attributed to primary water stress corrosion cracking through the J-Groove weld. The G1 heater, heater sleeve and J-Groove weld were removed. An American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code approved welded sleeve and plug repair was performed to repair the location. The flaw characterization at the G1 location determined that the flaw was radial-axial and not circumferentially oriented. Therefore, no additional inspections of heater sleeves were required.
