Plant: Davis-Besse.
Anticipatory Reactor Trip System Actuated During Turbine Stop Valve Testing due to the Closure of a Main Turbine Stop Valve.
 On September 7, 2019, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 95 percent power, during scheduled Main Turbine Stop Valve 2 (MSV) testing, Main Turbine Stop Valve 4 unexpectedly stroked closed and Anticipatory Reactor Trip System (ARTS) actuated, tripping the reactor. 

 The most likely cause of the MSV 4 closure was mechanical binding / sticking or foreign material in the internals of the valve operating system (fast acting solenoid valve) causing its inadvertent actuation. 

 Actions taken include replacing and testing the MSV 4 fast acting solenoid valve and testing ARTS. Scheduled actions include replacing similar components on the other MSVs, and cleaning the EHC fluid sump, replacing the EHC fluid and particulate strainers. 

 This issue is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).
