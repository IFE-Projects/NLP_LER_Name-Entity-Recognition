This air leak impacted operation of the Control Room Emergency Air Temperature Control System (CREATCS) A Train. Two CREATCS trains are required to be operable in accordance with Technical Specification 3.7.11. At the time of this event, CREATCS B Train was out of service for planned maintenance. 

 The direct cause of this event is an air filter gasket leak. As corrective action, a different vendor approved gasket has been installed. 

 This condition is being reported as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).
