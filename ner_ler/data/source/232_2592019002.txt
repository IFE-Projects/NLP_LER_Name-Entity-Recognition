Plant: Browns Ferry 1.
Unanalyzed Condition due to Inoperable Security Doors Following a Lightning Strike.
 On September 10, 2019, at approximately 1502 Central Daylight Time (CDT) a lightning strike caused a power surge which disabled signal repeaters between the Local Intelligence Units (LIUs) of some security doors and the monitoring stations at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN). At 1830 CDT, it was discovered that some of the oncoming night shift personnel could not access particular areas which required keycard access. An extent of condition check conducted at 1934 CDT determined that access to the 1A and 3A Electric Board Rooms, which contain remote shutdown panels and Fire Safe Shutdown (FSS) equipment, was prohibited for the night shift personnel. This condition is reportable under Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) as an event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. Specifically, this condition impacted the ability of Operators to perform their required actions in FSS procedures within prescribed time limits if a fire had occurred. 

 The event was caused by lightning strike, which created a power surge, resulting in a security equipment communications failure. Access was restored to all plant areas at 2106 CDT. The immediate corrective action was to have Security and Operations personnel reset the malfunctioning equipment. This cleared the error and allowed the LIUs of the affected security doors to receive roster updates. As a corrective action to reduce the probability of recurrence, Site Security created a constantly-activated, all-access emergency keycard, as a contingency against future door LIU communication failures. SSI-16.1, "Compensatory Measures," is being revised to proceduralize the emergency keycard's use.
