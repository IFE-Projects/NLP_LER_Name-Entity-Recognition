Failure of Auxiliary Feedwater Rooms Interconnecting Door to Latch due to Worn Interlock.
 On June 22, 2021, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 100 percent power, the door separating the two Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pump Rooms could not be latched following normal use. The watertight door, which serves as a Fire, Flood, Tornado, Security, and High-Energy Line Break (HELB) barrier, could not be latched due to a degraded interlock mechanism. After approximately seven minutes, the issue with the interlock was resolved and the door was closed and latched. With the door closed but not latched, a postulated HELB in AFW Room 1 could have pushed the door open to allow the high-energy fluid to enter Room 2, potentially rendering the AFW equipment in Room 2 unable to perform its required function. A postulated break in Room 2 would push the door against the door jamb, keeping the door closed to protect Train 1 equipment. 

 The door interlock mechanism malfunction was due to mechanical binding caused by normal operational wear, which was due to a lack of specific direction in the annual preventive maintenance instructions for the door. Corrective actions include adding detailed inspection instructions to the door annual preventive maintenance instructions. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety.
