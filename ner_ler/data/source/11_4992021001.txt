Plant: South Texas 2.
Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications due to Inoperable Containment Isolation Valve.
 On July 1, 2021, at 2344 hours, the STP Nuclear Operating Company discovered that Steam Generator 2D outside reactor containment isolation valve FV-4150 was indicating valve closure but only reduced the flow rate by about 8.33%. On July 2, 2021, at 0350 hours, the valve was declared inoperable due to inadequate isolation. Site engineering determined on July 12, 2021, that FV-4150 was inoperable since March 29, 2021, due to preventative maintenance performed on that date. On July 3, 2021, FV-4150 was determined to be operable following a valve stem adjustment and a satisfactory performance of the surveillance test. 
 The causes of the event were associated with inadequate written guidance. This event is reportable because the Technical Specification 3.6.3 required action statement for an inoperable containment isolation valve was not met. Specifically, the containment isolation valve was inoperable from March 29, 2021, to July 3, 2021, for a total of 96 days. The allowed outage time is 24 hours or apply the requirements of the configuration risk management program. Planned corrective actions include revising the work instructions and the post-maintenance testing guidance.
