Control Room Emergency Ventilation System Inoperable due to Main Control Room Door Being Left Open.
 At 0835 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on July 15, 2020, a Main Control Room (MCR) alarm was received for low control room positive pressure. In response to the alarm, a Control Room Envelope (CRE) door was found ajar and immediately closed. Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.10, Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS), was declared not met for both trains and Condition B entered. At 0839 EDT on July 15, 2020, the alarm cleared, CREVS was declared operable and LCO 3.7.10, Condition B was exited. 

 This event was caused by a human performance error when an individual traversing the control building complex did not fully challenge and ensure a MCR envelope boundary door was properly latched and secured. The open control room door was identified and promptly closed. The worker was coached. Actions to prevent recurrence include briefing affected work groups, developing a video on door operation and to establish a dynamic learning activity for contract personnel that will be part of outage training. 

 This condition is being reported as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).
