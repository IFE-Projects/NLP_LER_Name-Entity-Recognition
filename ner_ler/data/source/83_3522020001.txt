Valid Automatic Actuation of the Reactor Protection System with the Reactor Critical due to Closure of One Main Steam Isolation Valve.
 A valid automatic actuation of the reactor protection system (RPS) occurred due to a high reactor pressure condition following an unexpected closure of the 1B Inboard Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV). The valve failed closed when a fitting installed on the instrument gas supply tubing sheared at the Primary Containment Instrument Gas (PCIG) MSIV manifold. The reactor scram was the result of a high reactor pressure condition due to the unexpected closure of the 1B Inboard MSIV following the failure of PCIG tubing. The failure was caused by an overstressed tubing and fitting in combination with a vibratory environment capable of driving the fitting to failure. The overstressed condition resulted from an ambiguous procedure, permitting reusing a welded-in tubing connector that had the thread repaired. The tubing was replaced and the welded-in connector will be replaced at the next opportunity. The Maintenance Procedure will be revised to remove ambiguous direction which allowed the use of the repaired fitting. A piping modification will be installed on the Inboard MSIV manifold tubing to reduce the vibration at the connection.
