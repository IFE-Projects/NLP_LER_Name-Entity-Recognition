Plant: Fermi 2.
Secondary Containment Pressure Exceeded Technical Specification due to Reactor Building HVAC Damper Malfunction.
 On December 18, 2019, at 0908 EST, with the East and Center Reactor Building Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (RBHVAC) trains in service, secondary containment (SC) pressure degraded to the point where the Technical Specification (TS) for SC pressure was exceeded for approximately 4 minutes. The maximum SC pressure recorded during that time was 0.064 inches of vacuum water gauge. SC pressure was restored to within TS limits by manually starting the Division 1 Standby Gas Treatment System. There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with this event. The cause of this momentary loss of SC TS requirements was determined to be a failure in the Center RBHVAC exhaust fan inlet damper positioner. For corrective actions, Fermi 2 has upgraded two of the three RBHVAC exhaust inlet damper positioners and scheduled an upgrade replacement of the third.
