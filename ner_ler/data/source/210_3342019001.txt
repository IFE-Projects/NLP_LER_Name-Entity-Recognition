Low Head Safety Injection Discharge Relief Valve Did Not Reseat During Surveillance Test.
 On November 2, 2019, during the Unit 1 twenty-sixth refueling outage (1R26), while performing a surveillance test on the `A' Low Head Safety Injection (LHSI) Pump, the 'A' LHSI discharge relief valve lifted and did not reseat, resulting in approximately 850 gallons of Emergency Core Cooling System water from the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) being discharged to the local area sump. At 1515 hours, the RWST was declared Inoperable due to low level. The 'A' LHSI discharge relief valve was isolated to prevent further leakage, and makeup to the RWST was commenced. At 1602 hours, the RWST was declared Operable. The cause was that personnel did not implement actions intended to ensure that the guide ring settings for spare Crosby relief valves were verified, validated, and corrected, resulting in the valve being installed during 1R26 with its guide ring likely improperly set. 

 Engineering analysis determined that the postulated design basis Large Break Loss of Coolant Accident would exceed regulatory limits and the projected dose would exceed the Exclusion Area Boundary dose limit, and the General Design Criteria 19 for control room dose limit. The safety significance of the relief valve lifting was very low. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B), (C), (D) as reported by Event Notification 54366 on November 2, 2019 at 2303 hours.
