Plant: Millstone 3.
Plant Shutdown Required by Technical Specifications, Emergency Diesel Generator Exceeded Allowed Outage Time.
 On December 17, 2019 at 1936 hours, while operating in Mode 1, at 100% power, Millstone Power Station Unit 3 (MPS3) operators commenced an orderly shutdown of MPS3 when it was determined that the 'A' Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) maintenance, modifications and testing would not be completed within the allowed outage time by Technical Specification Action Statement (TSAS) 3.8.1.1 action b.5. The TSAS required that the plant be placed in Hot Standby (HSBY) within 6 hours and Cold Shutdown within the following 30 hours. The plant entered Hot Standby on December 18, 2019 at 0117 hours and entered Cold Shutdown on December 18, 2019 at 1948 hours.

 During the post maintenance testing activities, the EDG first experienced unexpected EDG load reductions and then turbocharger surging. The load reductions were caused by an intermittent speed signal change (while paralleled to the grid). This was resolved by implementing a design change to utilize a magnetic pick up speed signal. The primary resolution for turbocharger surging was the replacement of the newly installed spread exhaust system with the original exhaust system, which was removed during the plant maintenance activities. Resolving these two unrelated issues required more than the TSAS Allowed Outage Time to correct.

 This condition is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(A) - The completion of any nuclear plant shutdown required by the plant's technical specifications.
