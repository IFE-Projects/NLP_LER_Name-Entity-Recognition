Plant: Browns Ferry 3.
Main Steam Relief Valves Lift Settings Outside of Technical Specifications Required Setpoints.
 On May 8, 2020, the Tennessee Valley Authority was notified of as-found testing results that two Main Steam Relief Valves (MSRVs) from Unit 3 were outside the +/- 3 percent setpoint band required for operability. 

 More than the one allowed MSRV was considered to be inoperable during the entire operating cycle and longer than permitted by Technical Specifications. Additionally during this time, BFN, Unit 3 entered a Mode of operation which was not allowed under this condition. The affected valves remained capable of maintaining reactor pressure within American Society of Mechanical Engineers code limits.

 It was determined that these MSRVs failed due to corrosion bonding between the pilot valve disc and seat. As a corrective action for this condition, all thirteen of the MSRV pilot valves were replaced during the Unit 3 Spring 2020, refueling outage with pilot discs coated in platinum utilizing the Plasma Enhanced Magnetron Sputtering (PEMS) Deposition method. PEMS provides a more consistent and forgiving finish on the pilot valve seating surface and gives the platinum more inherent ductility than what the previous disposition method provided. BFN began using the PEMS method in 2019, so the valves involved in this event did not receive PEMS deposited platinum coatings during their last rebuild. The PEMS method was used for the pilot discs of the rebuilt valves installed during the Unit 3 Spring 2020 refueling outage, and will be used for all pilot discs going forward.
