Plant: Brunswick 1.
Technical Specification Required Shutdown due to Unidentified Leakage.
 At 12:05 Eastern Daylight Time on March 24, 2020, with Unit 1 in Mode 1, at approximately 22% power, coming out of a refueling outage, a Technical Specification required shutdown was initiated due to increased drywell leakage. The reactor was shutdown in accordance with normal shutdown procedures. Reactor water level reached low level 1 (LL1) following the shutdown. Per design, the LL1 signal resulted in automatic actuation of the Primary Containment Isolation System with closure of Group 2, 6, and 8 isolation valves. The shutdown was uncomplicated and all control rods inserted as expected. 

 The increased drywell leakage was a result of an intermediate-position failure of Safety Relief Valve '1F' in conjunction with opening of the associated vacuum breaker. The cause of this failure was determined to be susceptibility of the Target Rock two stage Safety Relief Valve design to fretting wear of the main disc stem to piston connection when the associated main body is subjected to a high number of cycles during testing, resulting in displacement of the piston and galling in the main body piston guide. Safety Relief Valve '1F' pilot and main valve were replaced and retested upon restart from the reactor shutdown. 

 There was no impact on the health and safety of the public or plant personnel. This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(A) due to the completion of a Technical Specification required shutdown, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to valid actuation of the Primary Containment Isolation System.
