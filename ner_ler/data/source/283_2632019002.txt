Two Manual Primary Containment Isolation Valves Found Open Resulting in a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specification.
 On 6/11/2019 during troubleshooting activities, two in-series manual 1" Primary Containment Isolation Valves (PCIVs), AS-78 and AS-79, were discovered to be open. In Mode 1 the required position of the PCIVs is closed. Investigation determined the valves were left open following a maintenance activity during a recent refueling outage. No formal tracking mechanism had been used for these valves to ensure plant configuration was restored following the maintenance activity as required by procedure. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) "as a condition was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications"; 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C), "event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function to control the release of radioactive material"; and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), "event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function to mitigate the consequences of an accident". There were no actual safety consequences from this condition. The immediate corrective action was to close the valves and independently verify they were locked closed. The applicable procedure will be revised to ensure clarity for when equipment manipulation per Operations Shift Supervisor direction is allowed and what formal tracking methods should be used to ensure equipment is returned to the required position.
