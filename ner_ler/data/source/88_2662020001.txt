Plant: Point Beach 1.
Reactor Coolant System Pressure Boundary Leak on Steam Generator Bowl Drain Line Results in Operation Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On October 3, 2020, Point Beach Unit 1 was shut down for refueling outage U1R39. At 0913 hours while performing inspections during the MODE 3 descending walkdown, a through-weld leak was identified on the steam generator (SG) 1B channelhead drain line at the drain isolation valve weld. 

 The cause of the condition was high cycle fatigue that initiated from a small weld defect at the root of the socket fillet weld. Corrective actions included the removal of the weld defect and the drain valve and installing a cap on the SG channelhead drain line 1B. 

 This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) and 10 CFR 50,73(a)(2)(i)(B).
