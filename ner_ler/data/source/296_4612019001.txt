Main Feed Breaker Failed to Close During Bus Shift.
 On May 22, 2019, at 0925 CDT, at approximately 98.4% power while attempting to transfer 4160V bus 1A1 to the Reserve Auxiliary Transformer (RAT) (main) from the Emergency Reserve Auxiliary Transformer (ERAT) (reserve), RAT 4160V bus 1A1 main feed breaker 1AP07EK failed to close and immediately indicated tripped. A walkdown of feed breaker 1AP07EK showed no abnormal indications or relay flags. Feed breaker 1AP07EK was replaced and tested satisfactory. Initial troubleshooting identified that the latch check switch breaker closure permissive was not made up: As this permissive makes up following breaker closure it has been determined that feed breaker 1AP07EK was inoperable since April 17, 2019. The cause of the breaker failure was determined to be establishment of a breaker preventive maintenance strategy which was beyond the capability of the Molykote BR-2 lubricant used in the breaker. Changes to DHP Breaker preventive maintenance frequencies will be implemented to ensure that lubrication periodicities support the effective life of the lubricant. In addition, DHP Breaker maintenance and refurbishment procedures will be revised to incorporate use of Molykote G-4700 grease in place of Molykote BR-2. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as, "any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications."
