Plant: Peach Bottom 2.
Safety Relief Valve Inoperability due to Nitrogen Leakage from Braided Hose Wear.
 On March 21, 2021 it was identified that the Unit 2 instrument nitrogen compressors were increasing in run hours, with all other related parameters steady. The condition was monitored and trended, and investigation determined the most likely cause to be nitrogen leakage within primary containment. In May, a second step increase in nitrogen leakage occurred, after which the decision was made to down power the unit to permit entry into primary containment and investigate the source of leakage. The plant reached a minimum of approximately 10% power to support this evolution. On May 18, 2021 it was discovered by visual observation that the nitrogen supply to a safety relief valve (RV-2-02-071K) was the source of the leak. Stainless steel braided hoses (1/2‚Äù Swagelok flexible hoses) which supply and return nitrogen from the actuating solenoid valve had rubbed together and worn such that both hoses had failed. The valve was declared inoperable for its Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) function on May 18, 2021 at 0117. The hoses were replaced, restoring operability on May 18, 2021 at 1225, and the unit was returned to full power. There were no other systems which were inoperable during this evolution that contributed to this event. This condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) for a condition not allowed by Technical Specifications and also reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) for a loss of safety function for the ADS system, based on subsequent analysis of the leakage. 

There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event.
