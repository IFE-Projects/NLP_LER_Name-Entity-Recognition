Plant: River Bend.
Core Monitoring System Software Modeling Error Resulted in Conditions Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On June 17, 2021, with River Bend Station (RBS) operating at 100 percent power, Entergy received a letter from GE Hitachi issuing SC 21-04, Revision 1, "Fuel Support Side Entry Orifice Meta-Stable Flow for 2 Beam Locations in the BWR/6 Reactors," identifying that the Global Nuclear Fuels (GNF) model for fuel affected by the Side Entry Orifices did not accurately account for the loss coefficients at those core locations causing a local overprediction in Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) margin. This resulted in the determination by Entergy that a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications (TSs) had existed at RBS and this report being made in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). 

 The cause of the event was GNF had not accurately accounted for the loss coefficients at applicable core locations causing a local overprediction in MCPR margin resulting in exceeding the MCPR TS limit. 

 Corrective actions include implementing a penalty to Operating Limit MCPR (OLMCPR) in the core monitoring system via an update to the databank to include all penalties associated with GEH letter SC 21-04, Revision 1, and an update to the current Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). 

 There were no consequences to the general safety of the public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, nor radiological safety.
