Plant: Millstone 2.
Incorrectly Placed Spent Fuel Assemblies in Unit 2 Spent Fuel Pool.
 On July 27, 2021, with Millstone Power Station Unit 2 (MPS2) in operational Mode 1, 100 percent reactor power, it was discovered that four spent fuel assemblies were placed in a region of the MPS2 Spent Fuel Pool (SFP) on July 15, 2021, for which they were not qualified by measured burnup. The configuration violated Technical Specifications, resulting in Technical Specification 3.9.18 Action Statement being entered on July 27, 2021, at 15:18. The direct cause of this condition was the incorrectly calculated projected burnup values for all fuel assemblies resident in the MPS2 Cycle 26 core which impacted fuel assemblies BB-65, BB-66, BB-67, and BB-68. The root cause was lack of specific guidance in the engineering standard used tocalculate projected burnup values. 

 The non-complying spent fuel assemblies were immediately moved to an acceptable location in Region 1 of the MPS2 SFP, and the TS 3.9.18 Action Statement was exited on July 27, 2021, at 17:29. The engineering standard used to perform the calculations to qualify spent fuel for storage in the SFP is being revised to include specific guidance to use measured assembly burnup values for MPS2 SFP qualification and to prohibit projection of assembly burnup. Additional corrective actions are being taken in accordance with the Corrective Action Program. 

 The spent fuel assemblies placed in the incorrect location in MPS2 SFP is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2) (i)(B) as a condition prohibited by technical specifications.
