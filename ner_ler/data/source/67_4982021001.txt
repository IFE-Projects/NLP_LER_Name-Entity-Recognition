Plant: South Texas 1.
Frozen Common Sensing Line Results in Loss of Two Main Feedwater Pumps Leading to Automatic Reactor Protection and
Auxiliary Feedwater Systems Actuations due to Low Steam Generator Level.
 On February 14, 2021, at 1516 hours the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station entered a period of abnormally cold weather. The temperatures on site reached 16 degrees Fahrenheit at the time of the event. A section of exposed common sensing line that fed pump protection switches for the Unit 1 steam generator feedwater pumps (SGFP) was not insulated or heat traced. The common line froze resulting in two out of three SGFPs tripping off-line. The Unit 1 reactor tripped on low steam generator level two minutes later. The startup feedwater pump tripped a short time afterwards from the same cause. 

 An organizational and programmatic root cause evaluation identified that station personnel implemented a freezing weather plan that was fragmented and lacked engagement, sufficient direction, verification of readiness, and designated ownership to ensure the station was prepared for abnormally cold weather. This event is reportable as an event that resulted in the automatic actuation of the Unit 1 reactor protection system and auxiliary feedwater system. Planned corrective actions include streamlining and revision of the freeze protection program and installing additional insulation and heat trace. 

 The event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates and there were no personnel injuries or damage to any safety-related equipment associated with this event. Additionally, all Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) equipment operated as designed. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public.
