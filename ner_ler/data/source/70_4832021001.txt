Manual Actuation of Essential Service Water System.
 On February 9, 2021, at 0838 operators commenced placing both trains of Essential Service Water (ESW) in manual alignments in accordance with annunciator response procedure OTA-RK-00014, Addendum 12A, "Service Water Pump Lockout." The manual actuation of ESW was in response to a condition where two non-safety Service Water (SW) pumps tripped and locked out due to low lubrication (lube) water pressure. 

 The cause of the trips and subsequent lockouts of the 'A' and 'B' SW pumps was attributed to low lube water pressure caused by fouling of the lube water Y-strainers. The fouling occurred since the normal weekly backflush of the Y-strainers could not be performed while a temporary alteration in support of maintenance (TASM) was installed in order to repair a leak in the permanent lube water piping. Preventive Maintenance (PM) tasks had not been initiated prior to the event to periodically clean the Y-strainers in order to compensate for the inability to backflush. 

 The initial corrective action taken in response to the event was cleaning of the Y-strainers in the lube water piping. In addition, PM tasks were created to clean the Y-strainers on a weekly basis for the remaining time that the TASM was installed. The permanent corrective action was to complete a modification to replace the section of the common lube water piping where the leak occurred. 

 Both trains of ESW were returned to standby alignments on February 9, 2021 at 1140.
