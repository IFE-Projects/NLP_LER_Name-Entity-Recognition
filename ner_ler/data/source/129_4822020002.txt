Faulted Supply Fan Motor Causes Diesel Generator Inoperability Longer than Technical Specification Completion Time.
 On June 25, 2020, at 1348 hours Central Daylight Time (CDT), the supply breaker to the 'B' Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) room supply fan was found to be tripped. Due to the outside temperature being above 79 deg. F, the 'B' EDG was declared inoperable 12 minutes later at 1400 CDT and Condition B of Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.8.1, "AC Sources - Operating" was entered at this time. Troubleshooting determined that the fan motor needed to be replaced. Based on operating experience, it was expected that the replacement and restoration of the motor would take longer than the Completion Time of Required Action B.4.1 which is to restore the EDG to operable status within 72 hours or a plant shutdown would be required. A Notice of Enforcement Discretion request was made to the NRC on June 28, 2020, to grant an additional 22 hours beyond the 72-hour Completion Time such that the Completion Time would expire at 1200 CDT on June 29, 2020. The NRC approved this request at 1240 CDT on June 28, 2020. The 'B' EDG supply fan motor was replaced and the 'B' EDG was returned to service at 0425 CDT on June 29, 2020, and Condition B of TS LCO 3.8.1 was exited at this time. 

 At the time of the event, the unit was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power. There was no impact to the health and safety of the public as a result of this event.
