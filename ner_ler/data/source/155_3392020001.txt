Plant: North Anna 2.
Technical Specification Required Shutdown due to Reactor Coolant System Pressure Boundary Leakage.
 On April 6, 2020 at 0037 hours with Unit 1 and Unit 2 in Mode 1, 100% power, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) unidentified leak rate increased from 0.0247 gallons per minute (gpm) to 0.1081 gpm. Multiple containment entries were made to identify the cause of the increase in unidentified leakage. On April 9, 2020 at 0100 hours a RCS pressure boundary leak was identified on the Unit 2 "A" Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) seal injection piping to its thermal barrier. At 0123 hours on April 9, 2020, operators began a controlled down power in accordance with station operating procedures to take Unit 2 offline and place it in Mode 5, Cold Shutdown conditions. While in Mode 5, the seal injection line welded connection to the "A" RCP was repaired. At 0337 on April 9, a 4-hour non-emergency report was made per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i) for "Initiation of plant shutdown required by Technical Specifications" and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) for "Any event or condition that results in the condition of the nuclear Power plant, including its principle safety barriers, being seriously degraded." Unit 1 continued to operate at 100% power, Mode 1, during the event. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.
