High Pressure Coolant Injection System Declared Inoperable due to Brief Loss of Power to HPCI Pump Flow Controller.
 On August 22, 2019 at 2234 EST with Unit 2 operating at 100% rated thermal power, the "High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) system inverter circuit failure" alarm was received on a Main Control Room panel. This alarm indicates a loss of AC power from the HPCI inverter, and is caused by either a loss of DC power to, or a failure of, the inverter. Operating personnel immediately noticed the loss of indication on several digital recorders and on the HPCI flow controller. At 2235 EST, the "HPCI system inverter circuit failure" alarm cleared, and all referenced digital indications returned to normal. 

 Subsequent investigation into the HPCI inverter circuit failure revealed a failed ceramic capacitor in the HPCI turbine speed control power supply. The failed capacitor caused a short-circuit condition that momentarily drew power down on the HPCI inverter. This caused a momentary loss of indication to the referenced digital recorders and a momentary loss of power to the HPCI flow controller. In the event of a valid HPCI initiation signal, the momentary loss of power to the HPCI flow controller would have resulted in a loss of HPCI function. Operations personnel therefore declared HPCI inoperable at 2234 EST. 

 The cause of the capacitor failure was not determined. Ceramic capacitors of this type are not known to fail at a specified frequency and are not recommended for replacement on a periodic basis. The HPCI turbine speed control power supply was subsequently removed from service, replaced, and the new power supply tested satisfactorily.
