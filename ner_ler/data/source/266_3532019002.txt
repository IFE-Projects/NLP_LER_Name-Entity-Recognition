Emergency Diesel Generator Lube Oil Pressure Sensing Line Leak Resulting in a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On 7/22/19, the instrumentation line threaded pipe connection for a pressure indicator, was found sheared during Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) D24 slow start monthly run. The one-quarter inch instrumentation line threaded connection tees off the four-inch main lube oil piping near the discharge of the engine driven lube oil pump. Prior to the run there was no indication of a leak at this connection. This threaded pipe was pro-actively replaced on 5/23/18, and on 1/21/19 the threaded pipe connection failed due to high-cyclic fatigue. The corrective actions to address the failure on 1/21/19 were to install a support on the threaded connection and repair a broken U-bolt. These actions did not resolve the underlying condition. The cause of the failure on 7/22/19 was high-cyclic fatigue experienced at the threaded pipe connection. The corrective action is to redesign the connection to reduce the stress on the threaded pipe connection. In the interim, the instrument line was removed from service.
