Plant: Robinson 2.
Turbine Trip / Reactor Trip due to Main Generator Lockout.
 At 0840 hours Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on 08/11/2019 with the plant in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2 (HBRSEP2), experienced an electrical fault within the main generator exciter. The exciter field breaker tripped due to a loss of generator field excitation, causing a main generator lockout. As a result, HBRSEP2 experienced an automatic turbine trip and subsequent reactor trip. Plant safety systems operated as designed. Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps started as expected. The plant was stabilized in Mode 3 and subsequently cooled to Mode 4. 

 The exciter was removed and shipped from HBRSEP2 to a vendor where it was disassembled, tested and inspected. This inspection identified extensive exciter damage. Due to the extensive damage, the precise failure cause is indeterminate. 

 Actions taken to correct the condition were to reinstall a refurbished exciter. HBRSEP2 returned to power operation on 09/03/2019. There was no impact to the health and safety of the public as a result of this event.
