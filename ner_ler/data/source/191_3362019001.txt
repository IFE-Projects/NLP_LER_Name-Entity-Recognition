Plant: Millstone 2.
Manual Reactor Trip due to Loss of the 'A' Steam Generator Feed Pump.
 On December 27, 2019 at 0704 while operating in MODE 1 at 100 percent power, operators manually tripped the Millstone Power Station Unit 2 (MPS2) reactor due to lowering steam generator levels caused by a loss of flow from the 'A' Steam Generator Feed Pump (SGFP). 

 The direct cause was the failure of the coupling connecting the MPS2 'A' Steam Generator Feed Pump (M2P1A) to the Steam Generator Feed Pump Turbine (M2H-5A). 

 The failed 'A' SGFP coupling was replaced and MPS2 was returned to service. 

 The actuation of Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of systems listed in 10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(iv)(B).
