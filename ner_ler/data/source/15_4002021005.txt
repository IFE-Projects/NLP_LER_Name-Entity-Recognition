Past Inoperability of Effluent Accident Monitor Exceeded Time Allowed by Technical Specifications.
 On June 22, 2021, the Waste Processing Building (WPB) Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was found to have incorrect database values used for flow rate measurement, which rendered this monitor inoperable. The database values for this radiation monitor were immediately corrected upon discovery of this condition and operability was restored on June 22, 2021. Following investigation, it was determined that this radiation monitor was inoperable since October 6, 2020. During completion of a surveillance test on this radiation monitor on October 6th, the database values were restored incorrectly. Maintenance personnel did not recognize a note in the Radiation Monitor Data Sheet Library that requires substitute values to be entered when the flow transmitter for this radiation monitor is inoperable. Since this radiation monitor was not known to be inoperable from October 6, 2020, through June 22, 2021, no alternate method for monitoring was implemented and no special report was completed as required by Technical Specifications (TS). The WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor is credited as one of two WPB exhaust effluent monitors in TS Table 3.3-10, Accident Monitoring Instrumentation. This event had no significance with respect to the health and safety of the public. Actions to ensure tracking of the flow rate monitor status have been completed.
