Reactor Water Cleanup System Differential Flow Instrumentation Inoperable.
 On 09/16/19, at 0817 CDT, at approximately 0% power during shutdown for refueling outage C1R19, the Division 1 and Division 2 Reactor Water Cleanup (RT) system differential flow instrumentation was declared inoperable due to failing downscale caused by flashing in the sensing lines that occurred during reactor cooldown. The Division 1 and 2 RT differential flow instrumentation were declared inoperable in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.6.1. Thecause of this event was unit shutdown procedures were not optimized to increase subcooling in the RT system during reactor cooldown. The system alignment was changed in accordance with procedures to increase subcooling and indication was restored by 0852 CDT on 09/16/19. Procedures governing unit shutdown will be revised to increase subcooling in the RT system during reactor cooldown to reduce the likelihood of flashing in the sensing lines. This condition met the reportability requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
