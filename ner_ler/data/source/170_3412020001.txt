Secondary Containment Inoperable due to Both Airlock Doors Open.
 On March 5, 2020, at 1235 EST, with the reactor at 100 percent core thermal power and steady state conditions, both doors in the secondary containment (SC) airlock on the reactor building fifth floor were open at the same time for a period of approximately three seconds. Both doors being open at the same time resulted in the Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.4.1.3 not being met. The cause of the event was a brief, inadvertent, simultaneous opening of both doors due to normal personnel ingress/egress. No equipment failures or human performance errors occurred. The doors were closed in approximately 3 seconds and SC was restored in accordance with the TS. No further corrective actions were required. The maximum SC pressure observed during the time both doors were open remained within TS limits. There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with this event.
