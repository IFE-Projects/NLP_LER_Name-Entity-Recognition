Automatic Actuation of the Reactor Protection System Resulting from a Loss of Reactor Coolant Pumps.
 On February 26, 2021, at approximately 1033 Mountain Standard Time, a reactor trip of PVNGS Unit 2 occurred. A loss of power to the 13.8 kV non-class bus without a subsequent, expected fast bus transfer, caused two of four Reactor Coolant Pumps to trip. This resulted in an automatic, uncomplicated Unit 2 reactor trip when the Reactor Protection System generated trips on all four channels for low departure from nucleate boiling ratio and high local power density following a main turbine generator trip. 

 The event was initiated by inadvertent contact of a test switch in the Salt River Project switchyard. The probable cause of the failure to initiate a fast bus transfer was found to be surface debris and contaminants on the circuit contacts of the fast bus transfer auto/manual selector switch. The switch was replaced on February 27, 2021. Unit 2 entered Mode 1 on February 28, 2021. 

 No other Reactor Protection System actuation signals or actuations of plant engineered safety features systems occurred and all control element assemblies fully inserted into the reactor core. PVNGS Unit 1 and Unit 3 were operating at 100 percent power at the time of the event and were not impacted by the Unit 2 reactor trip. 

 Two previous similar events were reported by PVNGS in the last 3 years via Licensee Event Reports (LER) 05000529-2019-001-00 and 05000530-2018-001-00.
