Plant: Watts Bar 1.
Control Room Emergency Ventilation System Inoperable due to Main Control Room Door Being Left Open.
 On November 15, 2019, on two occasions, a Main Control Room (MCR) alarm was received for low control room positive pressure. At 2234, and again at 2353 Eastern Standard Time (EST), a Control Room Envelope (CRE) door was found ajar and immediately closed. Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.10, Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS), was declared not met for both trains and Condition B entered for both instances. At 2236 EST, and at 2355 EST on November 15, 2019, the alarm cleared, CREVS was declared operable and LCO 3.7.10, Condition B was exited.

 These events were caused by human performance errors when individuals traversing the control building complex failed to confirm the MCR envelope boundary door was properly latched. The open control room door was identified and promptly closed. Contributing to this event, maintenance had been performed on the door sweep which resulted in the door involved not closing on its own. Immediate corrective actions included posting a door watch, coaching the individuals involved, and correcting the door sweep issue. Actions to prevent recurrence include training on proper door maintenance post maintenance testing and increased observations of plant staff related to door operation. 

 This condition is being reported as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).
