Plant: LaSalle 2.
Reactor Protection System Half Scram due to Motor Generator Set Output Breaker Trip.
 On May 31, 2021, LaSalle Unit 2 was operating at 100 percent power, when the 2A reactor protection system (RPS) motor generator (MG) set output breaker tripped due to an overload condition, which resulted in a loss of 2A RPS bus. Loss of power to this bus created a half-scram and initiated closure of outboard isolation valves in multiple systems. The condition was an invalid actuation because it was not the result of actual plant conditions and not an intentional manual action. Actuations and isolations that occurred performed as designed, except for the outboard 2D main steam line isolation valve (MSIV) drain valve that was discovered later as having a slow closure time, rendering the component inoperable. 

 The cause of the MG set breaker trip was a degraded voltage adjustment potentiometer on the associated MG set, which caused the output voltage to fluctuate. The RPS bus loss resulted in general containment isolation signals that affected containment isolation valves in more than one system while the unit was critical. Therefore, the condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). 

 The cause of the MSIV drain valve slow closure is indeterminate, pending further investigation. There was no loss of safety function since an inboard isolation valve in the flow-path remained operable. However, the condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by technical specifications (TS) due to having an inoperable component longer than permitted by TS.
