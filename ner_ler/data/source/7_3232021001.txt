Plant: Diablo Canyon 2.
Emergency Diesel Generator declared Inoperable due to Low Frequency Condition Discovery During Routine Surveillance.
 On July 22, 2021, with Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 2, operating at 100 percent power, DCPP personnel determined that since June 30, 2021, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 2-3 would not have been able to attain Technical Specification (TS) minimum frequency when started in automatic. Manual control of diesel frequency was not affected. This condition was discovered via a routine surveillance test which evaluates, in part, EDG frequency during standby and loading conditions. 

 This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation of the plant in a condition prohibited by DCPP TS due to the EDG frequency being outside TS required limits for a period beyond the TS required completion time. This event is also being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. However, upon discovery, the remaining two of the three EDGs were operable. 

 The condition was corrected and the EDG was restored to Operable status on July 22, 2021. A subsequent evaluation determined that the low frequency condition did not prevent EDG 2-3 from performing its specified safety function.
