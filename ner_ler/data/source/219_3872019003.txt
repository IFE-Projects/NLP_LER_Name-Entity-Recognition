Plant: Susquehanna 2.
D Diesel Generator Inoperable due to Inadequate Post-Maintenance Test.
 On October 13, 2019, at 10:08, during performance of surveillance testing, the D Diesel Generator (DG) failed to reach the required frequency within the time specified by the acceptance criteria. Operators declared Surveillance Requirement 3.8.1.7 failed and entered Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.8.1, Condition B, on both Susquehanna Steam Electric Station units for the inoperable D DG. The other three DGs (A, B, and C) were verified to be OPERABLE before operators commenced a subsequent test of the D DG at 12:12, during which the D DG met all required acceptance criteria. The D DG was declared OPERABLE at 17:56 and LCO 3.8.1, Condition B, was exited for both units.

 The failure to reach the required frequency within the acceptance criteria was the result of inadequate oil pressure in the D DG mechanical governor internals which was caused by an inadequate Post Maintenance Test (PMT). The condition of the inoperable D DG was determined to have existed since September 17, 2019, and the event was determined to be reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS. Due to a concurrent inoperability of the C DG, the event was also determined to be reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as an event or condition which could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function. Corrective actions include procedure updates to ensure adequate PMTs are performed in the future. 

 There were no actual safety consequences associated with this event.
