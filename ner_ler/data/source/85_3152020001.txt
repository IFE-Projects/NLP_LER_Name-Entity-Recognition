Unit 1 Containment Closure Requirements Not Met During Refueling Operations.
 On October 12, 2020, at 23:56, Operations was notified that the Unit 1 Containment 612 Elevation Personnel Airlock Assembly equalization valves had been removed by Maintenance personnel on October 2, 2020, and were not reinstalled until approximately 20:00 on October 12, 2020. While the valves were removed, the movement of irradiated fuel assemblies within Containment to support the Unit 1 Cycle 30 core reload occurred between October 4, 2020, at 16:16 and October 6, 2020, at 14:44. During this time when there was movement of irradiated fuel assemblies within Containment, a Containment Penetration (equalization valves) that provided direct access from the Containment atmosphere to the outside atmosphere was not closed by a manual or automatic isolation valve, blind flange, or equivalent as required by Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.3. TS LCO 3.9.3, Condition A, requires that the movement of irradiated fuel assemblies within Containment be suspended immediately when one or more Containment Penetrations are not in a required status. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS because TS LCO 3.9.3, Condition A was not met from October 4, 2020, at 16:16 to October 6, 2020, at 14:44. 

 The cause of the event has been preliminarily determined to be lack of procedural guidance. Planned corrective actions include incorporating additional guidance into Operations procedures for Refueling Integrity and Containment Isolation.
