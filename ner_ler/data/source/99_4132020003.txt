Plant: Catawba 1.
Valid Actuation of the Unit 1 Reactor Protection System and Auxiliary Feedwater System.
 At 0925 [EST] hours on September 8, 2020, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power, Catawba Unit 1 experienced an automatic reactor trip on Overpower Delta Temperature. During routine Nuclear Instrumentation System calibration activities, Unit 1 Channel 1 Overpower Delta Temperature was placed in a tripped condition as part of a planned evolution. As a result of human error, an inadvertent Channel 2 Overpower Delta Temperature signal was received which initiated the reactor trip. The trip was not complex, with all systems responding normally post-trip. Because of the reactor trip, the Auxiliary Feedwater system actuated as expected due to an Anticipated Transient Without Scram Mitigation System Actuation Circuitry signal. 

 The cause of the reactor trip was a human performance error in which a performer did not perform self-checking prior to pulling a Nuclear Instrumentation System power range drawer. Corrective actions include appropriate accountability and remediation actions with a focus on specific behaviors for all maintenance plant manipulations. 

 There was no impact to the health and safety of the public.
