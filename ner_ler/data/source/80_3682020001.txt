Plant: Arkansas 2.
Loss of Feedwater Control System Power for Train 'A' Feedwater that Resulted in Plant Trip.
 On December 10, 2020, at 1608 CST, while in MODE 1 at 100 percent power, Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 2 (ANO-2) experienced an automatic reactor scram due to low steam generator water level in the 'A' Steam Generator (SG). The low SG water level was caused by loss of power to the 'A' Feedwater Control System (FWCS) due to power supply failures in the 'A' FWCS cabinet. This resulted in main feedwater flow demand to the 'A' Main Feedwater Pump (MFP) and associated feedwater regulating valves to fail to minimum. Emergency Feedwater (EFW) actuated automatically due to low water level in the 'A' SG. The failure of the 'A' FWCS power supplies affected post-trip response of the 'B' FWCS, which resulted in water level in the 'B' SG rising to a level requiring manual trip of the 'B' MFP. EFW responded as designed to feed both steam generators automatically. The plant was stabilized in MODE 3. The other safety systems responded as designed. Electrical power was supplied from offsite power and maintained unit electrical loads as designed. The 'B' MFP remained available using approved plant procedures. 

 There were no consequences to the general safety of the public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, or radiological safety. No radiological releases have occurred due to this event.
