Degraded Differential Pressure Indicating Switch in the LPCI Loop Select Logic Caused by Water Damage Results in a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On September 20, 2019, one of four channels for the 3A reactor recirculation pump high differential pressure function failed the channel functional test. Technical Specification 3.3.5.1, "EGGS Instrumentation," requires all four channels to be operable. Technical Specification 3.3.5.1, Condition C identifies a Completion Time of 24 hours to restore the failed channel to operable status. The degraded differential pressure switch was replaced. The channel was restored to operable within the 24 hour time limit.

 On June 20, 2019, the Unit 3 East Low Pressure Coolant Injection Room cooler was found leaking water onto the panel where recirculation pump differential pressure switches are installed. On July 30, 2019, a surveillance documented that all four channels were functional. The failed channel was determined to be inoperable between July 30 and September 20, 2019, which is longer than the 24 hours allowed by Technical Specification. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), a condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. The cause of the degraded differential pressure switch was due to water dripping from the Low Pressure Coolant Injection room cooler onto the instrumentation rack. Service Water is isolated to the Unit 3 East Low Pressure Coolant Injection Room cooler until the room cooler is repaired.
