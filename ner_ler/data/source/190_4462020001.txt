Plant: Comanche Peak 2.
Manual Reactor Trip due to Trip of Both Main Feedwater Pumps.
 At 1253 on January 1, 2020, Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant (CPNPP) Unit 2 was manually tripped due to a loss of Auxiliary Condenser vacuum on both Main Feedwater Pumps that caused both Main Feedwater Pumps to automatically trip on low vacuum. All safety systems functioned as designed and the Unit 2 Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps started as designed due to trip of both Main Feedwater Pumps. There was no impact on Unit 1. 

 The cause of this event was neither the on-shift crew nor the leadership supporting them recognized, understood or addressed the risk prior to throttling the Auxiliary Condenser outlet valves in the closed direction. Corrective Actions include removal of the involved Operations personnel pending Performance Improvement plans, additional around the clock field and control room oversight for two weeks with daily roll-ups, oral boards for all Operations personnel, re-performance of Leadership and Team Effectiveness assessments for crew composition, developing Behavioral Learning Activities, and conducting a site wide observation blitz.
