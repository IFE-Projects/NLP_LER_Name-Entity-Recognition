Plant: Susquehanna 1.
Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications due to Inoperable Turbine Stop Valve and Turbine Control Valve Instrumentation.
 On May 9, 2020, operators at the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES), Unit 1, were raising power following a maintenance outage. SSES Technical Specifications (TS) require that certain Turbine Stop Valve (TSV) and Turbine Control Valve (TCV) instrumentation be operable at greater than or equal to 26 percent Rated Thermal Power (RTP). However, at approximately 15:23, Unit 1 reached 26 percent RTP and the TSV and TCV instrumentation was found to be inoperable. Operators declared the TSV and TCV instrumentation inoperable, and entered Conditions A and B of Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.1.1. Control rods were inserted and Unit 1 was brought below 26 percent RTP at approximately 15:37, thereby exiting Conditions A and B of LCO 3.3.1.1. Based on the investigation and identified cause of this event, the inoperable condition likely existed prior to entering the Mode of Applicability. LCO 3.0.4 prohibits reaching 26 percent RTP when the LCO 3.3.1.1 is not met. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS. 

 The cause of the event was determined to be two socket weld failures caused by high cyclic fatigue. Additionally, one of the socket welds was found to be undersized for its application. This condition was corrected by repairing the welds and upgrading the welds to the proper size. There were no actual safety consequences associated with the described condition.
