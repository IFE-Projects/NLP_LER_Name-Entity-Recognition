Plant Vital Area Security Vulnerability Discovered Without Compensatory Security Measures.
 On February 18, 2021, at 16:00 Eastern Standard Time, with the plant in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), personnel discovered an uncompensated security vulnerability that could have allowed unauthorized or undetected access from a protected area to a vital area of the plant. Compensatory measures were promptly established and an immediate investigation was conducted that did not reveal any evidence of unauthorized entry or tampering. A nonsegregated electrical bus duct was removed using inadequate work instructions due to a change in work scope that was not properly communicated during execution. Work instructions for the bus duct removal were developed, but did not include steps to contact security to establish compensatory measures prior to beginning work within a penetration to a vital area barrier wall. No unauthorized access to the vital area occurred during the time period that the vulnerability existed. This event did not have any nuclear or personnel safety implications. A project manager has been assigned for the remaining non-segregated bus work and field oversight for this work has been established to ensure any further work scope changes are identified and properly planned.
