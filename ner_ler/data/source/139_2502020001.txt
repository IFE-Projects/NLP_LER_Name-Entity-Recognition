Plant: Turkey Point 3.
Technical Specification Action Not Taken for Unrecognized Inoperable Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) Instrument Channel Functional Units.
 On 5/7/2020 with Unit 3 at 100% power, during scheduled calibration of the Eagle 21 system, it was discovered that the deviation between indicated and reference Delta-T exceeded acceptance criterion. The affected instrument channel provides temperature readings to specific Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) functions. The two redundant instrument channels were unaffected. Upon discovery, the affected instrument channel was declared inoperable and the associated bi-stables were placed in the tripped (safe) condition in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) Table 3.3-1 Action 13 and Table 3.3-2 Action 25. The condition was corrected and instrument channel declared operable on 5/7/2020 at 2107 hours. During investigation, it was recognized that the condition existed since the baseline calibration that was performed during the recently completed refueling outage, exceeding the time limit specified in TS. The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) since TSAS AOTs were not met, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) since the condition was found to be a loss of safety function for the affected ESFAS Functional Units.
