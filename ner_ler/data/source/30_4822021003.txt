Automatic Reactor Trip due to Low Steam Generator Level.
 On 5/12/2021, Wolf Creek Generating Station was performing initial reactor startup following Refueling Outage 24 (RF24). With reactor power at approximately 8%, steam generator levels began to oscillate while in automatic control. Operators took manual control of the main feedwater regulating bypass valves but were unable to stabilize steam generator levels prior to reaching the “C” steam generator low level reactor trip setpoint. At 1125 Central Daylight Time (CDT), the reactor tripped and an auxiliary feedwater actuation occurred. All equipment responded as expected. ENS notification #55252 was made at 1441 CDT in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) due to reactor scram, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for a specified system actuation. 

 The cause of the event was determined to be during the 7300 modification, improper utilization of main feedwater regulating bypass valves inherent valve curves did not take into consideration system flow characteristics. The result was an inaccurate correlation of feed flow with valve position within the system. This led to a mismatch in feed flow demand and actual feed flow to the steam generators. Due to improper gain settings, the mismatch began to diverge and led to a reactor trip on low steam generator water level. Following tuning of control parameters, operators were able to commence reactor startup and reached full power on 5/15/2021.
