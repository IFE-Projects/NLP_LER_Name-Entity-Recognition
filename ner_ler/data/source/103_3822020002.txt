Plant: Waterford 3.
Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications for Technical Specification 3.4.5.1 (Reactor Coolant System Leakage Detection Instrumentation) due to Personnel Error.
 On August 24, 2020, Engineering identified that an incorrect and nonconservative moving filter particulate channel engineering conversion factor was being used for all radioactive particulate detectors installed at Waterford 3. Affected instruments included the containment atmospheric monitor particulate channel, which is required to be operable for reactor coolant system leakage detection per Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.5.1, "Leakage Detection Instrumentation." The containment atmospheric monitor particulate channel was declared inoperable per TS 3.4.5.1. The time period that the monitor was inoperable exceeded the allowed outage time of 30 days, resulting in an Event or Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications. 

 The cause of this event was personnel error. The vendor representative incorrectly calculated the conversion factor. The factors did not account for filter speed, flow rate, and flow-rate conversion factor. There was lack of vendor oversight on the part of the licensee when the factors were originally developed. Review of historical records identified that the condition had existed since installation (during the Waterford 3 construction phase, prior to startup). Corrective action to update the instrument with the correct conversion factor values was completed on September 10, 2020, thus restoring operability, and TS 3.4.5.1 was exited.
