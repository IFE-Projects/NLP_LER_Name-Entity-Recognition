Manual Reactor Scram Initiated in Response to Loss of Feedwater due to Abnormal Plant Configuration.
 On May 31, 2019, the Reactor was operating at 32% power with a planned shutdown in progress. The 'A' Low Pressure Feedwater Heater (LPFH) string was isolated due to level control issues in one of the heaters. The process of securing one of the Reactor Feedwater Pumps (FWP) resulted in higher than anticipated flow through the 'B' LPFH string. The high flow condition caused water level to rise in one of the 'B' LPFHs which resulted in automatic isolation and bypass of the LPFHs. The LPFH string isolation restricted supply flow to the operating FWPs resulting in an automatic trip of the pumps and a loss of all feedwater. At 23:45 a manual Reactor Scram was inserted. Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) was manually initiated for Reactor water level control. The 'C' FWP was restarted and Reactor water level control was transferred from RCIC to the 'C' FWP. The LPFH system configuration was not changed and approximately 43 minutes after the Scram, the 'C' FWP automatically tripped due to low suction pressure. Reactor water level lowered to level 3 causing a second Reactor Protection System actuation. Operators reestablished flow through the 'B' LPFH string and restarted the 'A' FWP restoring Reactor water level to the normal band. Corrective Actions are planned to revise procedures to accurately reflect the limitations of the configuration which lead to this event.
