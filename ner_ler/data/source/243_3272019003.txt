Plant: Sequoyah 1.
Automatic Reactor Trio due to Negative Rate Trio as a Result of a Dropped Control Rod.
 On August 27, 2019, at 0109 eastern daylight time, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, automatically tripped as a result of Control Bank D Control Rod H-8 dropping into the core. All safety related equipment operated as designed, all control rods fully inserted as required, and auxiliary feedwater automatically initiated as expected. Additionally, during a post trip review, it was identified that the Steam Generator #3 pressure transmitter, 1-PT-1-23, demonstrated sluggish behavior. This pressure transmitter had previously been identified as inoperable during a Unit 1 reactor trip occurring April 14, 2019. Maintenance was performed following the April event and the transmitter was declared operable. After further review, it was determined that the transmitter was inoperable since November of 2015. 

 For Control Rod H-8, the root cause was determined to be that excessive wear to the H-8 stationary gripper latch mechanism resulted in the inability to maintain the control rod in the fully, or nearly fully, withdrawn position for an extended period of time. The corrective action is to submit a license amendment request and develop an engineering design change to permanently remove Control Rod H-8. For 1-PT-1-23, the cause was determined to be the procedure associated with post maintenance testing did not identify that maintenance can affect the response time of the transmitters. The corrective action is to revise the procedure to note response time aspects should be considered when developing post maintenance testing for these transmitters.
