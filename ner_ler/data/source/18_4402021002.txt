Core Monitoring System Software Modeling Error Results in Conditions Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On June 17, 2021, with Perry Nuclear Power Plant (PNPP) operating at 100 percent power, PNPP received a letter from Gneral Electric - Hitachi (GEH) issuing SC 21-04, Revision 1, "Fuel Support Side Entry Orifice Meta-Stable Flow for 2 Beam Locations in the BWR/6 Reactors," identifying that the Global Nuclear Fuels (GNF) model for fuel affected by the Side Entry Orifices did not accurately account for the loss coefficients at those core locations causing a local overprediction in Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) margin. This resulted in the determination by PNPP that a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications (TSs) had existed at PNPP and this report being made in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). 

 The cause of the event is a legacy issue that is due to the flow geometries below the reactor core plate in the areas of Intermediate Range and Source Range neutron detector dry tubes, causing a local overprediction in MCPR margin resulting in exceeding the MCPR TS limit. 

 Corrective actions include updating the Cycle 19 Core Operating Limits Report (COLR) and associated documents to account for SC 21-04, Revision 1, and updating the Thermal Limit Files in the core monitoring software.
