Component Cooling Water System Alignment Led to Both Trains of Component Cooling Water Inoperable.
 On July 5, 2019, the 2A1 component cooling water (KC) pump discharge check valve 2KC-5 failed to close when the 2A1 KC pump was secured. The condition resulted in an unplanned entry into a 72-hour Technical Specification (TS) action statement for one train (2A) of KC inoperable. On July 6, 2019, during the repair of 2KC-5, the isolation boundary was expanded which caused Operations to perform an existing procedure which defeated the interlocks for the Non-Essential Reactor Building Supply and Return Header Valves to close on an engineered safeguards actuation signal. At the time, Operations was unaware that defeating the interlocks would cause a failure to meet a TS surveillance. Once the interlocks were defeated, the 2B KC Train should have also been declared inoperable due to the inability to meet the surveillance requirement. 

 The cause of this event was determined to be that a calculation and procedure change failed to identify the requirement to meet the TS surveillance. Operators also lacked a questioning attitude with information in the design bases document and approved procedures. Actions will be to correct procedures, implement training, and address the Operator learning. This event was determined to be reportable under 10CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B) for Condition Prohibited by TS and 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(v) for Event or Condition that Could Have Prevented Fulfillment of a Safety Function.
