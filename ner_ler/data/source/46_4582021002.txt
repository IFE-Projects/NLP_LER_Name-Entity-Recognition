Plant: River Bend.
Automatic Reactor Scram due to Turbine Control System Communication Fault.
 On April 2, 2021 at 1017 CT, River Bend Station was operating at 86% reactor power when a turbine trip signal caused a Main Turbine trip and an automatic reactor scram. All control rods fully inserted and there were no complications. All systems responded as designed. 

 The Main Turbine trip and reactor scram were caused by a random, spurious communication error within the Ovation Turbine Control System. The condition was repaired by replacing a communication module in the remote panel.
