Plant: Turkey Point 3.
Manual Reactor Trip in Response to Automatic Trip of the 3B Steam Generator Feedwater Pump.
 On 8/20/2020 at 23:58 hours the Unit 3 reactor was manually tripped from 34% power following an automatic trip of the 3B Steam Generator Feed Pump (SGFP). The 3B SGFP had tripped as a result of a low suction pressure condition that occurred when the pump recirculation valve was manually closed, which is the normal position for the plant conditions. The valve was open due to inadvertent mispositioning of the SGFP Recirculation Master Controller. The Auxiliary Feedwater System automatically initiated in response to the trip of the 3B SGFP. This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A) for actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW).
