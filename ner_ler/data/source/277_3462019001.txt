Plant: Davis-Besse.
Emergency Ventilation System Train Inoperable due to Non-specific Test Description of Damper Operation.
 On July 19, 2019, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 100 percent power, during a scheduled monthly Surveillance Test it was identified Emergency Ventilation System (EVS) Fan 1 failed to produce the desired negative pressure within the Shield Building Negative Pressure area because the recirculation and exhaust dampers were not modulating as required. The degraded differential pressure controller, caused by a premature failure of the controller, was replaced to restore EVS Train 1 Operability A review of the previous month's Surveillance Test performed on June 21, 2019, showed similar results were obtained, but it was not recognized at that time the dampers were not operating properly. It was determined that EVS Train 1 was inoperable for a 30-day period, which resulted in the plant operating in a condition prohibited by the Technical Specifications. The cause of the degraded controller not being' identified during the previous month's test was a lack of specific description of damper operation in the monthly Surveillance Test, and the tests for both EVS Trains have been revised to specify the expected/ required damper positions and to clarify the test acceptance criteria. 

 This issue is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).
