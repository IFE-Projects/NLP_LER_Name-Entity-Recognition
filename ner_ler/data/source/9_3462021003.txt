Reactor Trip due to Failed Uninterruptible Power Supply and Steam Feedwater Rupture Control System Actuations.
 On July 8, 2021, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 100 percent power, an automatic reactor trip occurred due to de-energization of Motor Control Centers caused by a breaker failure during planned testing. The simultaneous failure of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) caused a loss of power to the Main Generator Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR), resulting in a Generator lockout and trip of the Main Turbine and Reactor. Following the Reactor trip, overcooling was observed due to loss of power to a Moisture Separator Reheater steam source valve, and operators manually initiated Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) per procedure. The Steam and Feedwater Rupture Control System (SFRCS) actuated on low Steam Generator (SG) 1 level, starting the Auxiliary Feedwater System. During post-trip response, SG 2 low pressure was experienced while transferring Gland Steam Supply, actuating SFRCS to isolate Main Feedwater and close the Main Steam Isolation Valves. 

The cause of the reactor trip was inadequate review for impact on the UPS when selecting it as a power source during AVR installation.The cause of the subsequent SFRCS actuation was failure of the Gland Steam Seal feed valve pneumatic actuator. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as automatic actuations of the Reactor Protection and Auxiliary Feedwater Systems, and manual actuation of ECCS.
