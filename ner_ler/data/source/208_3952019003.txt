Plant: Summer 1.
Completion of a Technical Specification Required Plant Shutdown.
 On November 5, 2019, at 1041, while operating in Mode 1 at 100% reactor power, the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station entered Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) action statement 3.6.2.3.a as a result of having one group of Reactor Building Cooling Units (RBCU) inoperable. TS 3.6.2.3.a requires the inoperable group to be restored to operable status within seven days or be in at least hot standby within the next six hours and in cold shutdown within the following thirty hours.

 Due to ongoing efforts to identify an existing Reactor Coolant System (RCS) leak, the station conservatively shutdown to further investigate both the unidentified RCS leakage and the cause of the RBCU trips. The plant entered Mode 3 on November 7, 2019, at 0528, completing the plant shutdown. At the time of shutdown it was not evident that the failure could not be corrected within the LCO allowed outage time. Therefore, a notification was not submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i). This Licensee Event Report (LER) is being provided per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(A) because the RBCU condition was not restored within the seven day LCO allowed outage time.
