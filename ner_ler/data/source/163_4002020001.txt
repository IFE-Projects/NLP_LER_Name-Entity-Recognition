Automatic Reactor Trip During Turbine Control System Digital Electro-Hydraulic System Maintenance.
 On March 23, 2020, at 10:12 Eastern Daylight Time, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), experienced an automatic reactor trip following actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS). The trip occurred during restoration from a planned maintenance activity that impacted the auto-stop turbine (AST) trip function of the digital electro-hydraulic system utilized for turbine control. The activity activated pressure switches in the RPS, resulting in a reactor trip. All safety systems functioned as designed. The RPS actuation also resulted in isolation of the main feedwater system and actuation of the auxiliary feedwater system on steam generator low level, an expected condition following a reactor trip. 

 The trip signal was a result of the restoration activity causing a sufficient depressurization of the AST header to activate pressure switches that feed the RPS. The restoration activity contained an erroneous sequence that reflected the recommended sequence supplied by the manufacturer of the turbine control system (TCS). The TCS was restored to functional and the unit is back online. The restoration sequence will be revised. Due to the actuation of the RPS system and auxiliary feedwater, this event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv).
