Equipment Clearance Order Error Leads to Loss of Primary Containment Integrity.
 On September 5, 2019, it was discovered that an Equipment Clearance Order (ECO) to replace a degraded containment isolation valve on the outside of the Reactor Containment Building (RCB) had an error that resulted in a violation of Technical Specifications. The ECO incorrectly opened a test connection between the containment wall and a containment isolation valve inside the RCB that was required to be closed for Technical Specification compliance. When the degraded containment isolation valve on the outside of containment was removed, a leakage path out of containment was established. This resulted in a loss of one of the three fission product barriers and a violation of two Technical Specifications. Once the ECO error was recognized, Operations corrected the valve lineup to bring Unit 2 back into compliance with Technical Specifications. The root cause of the event was personnel error related. The two Licensed Senior Reactor Operators involved in the technical review and approval of the ECO failed to recognize at-risk behaviors and apply appropriate human performance tools. Corrective actions planned include procedure changes, as well as modifications to the software that controls the ECO process.
