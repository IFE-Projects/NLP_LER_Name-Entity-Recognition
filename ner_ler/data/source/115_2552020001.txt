Plant: Palisades.
Service Water System Inoperable for Longer than Allowed by Technical Specifications.
 On July 27, 2020, at 22:45 ET, while operating in Mode 1 at 100% power, Palisades Nuclear Plant (PNP) Operators identified that the Bettis operator pin on valve CV-0826, "Component Cooling Water Heat Exchanger E-54B Service Water Outlet," was incorrectly installed. This caused a failure of CV-0826 to open when demanded from the Control Room, rendering the left train of service water inoperable. The condition was corrected, and the Service Water System (SWS) was declared operable on July 28, 2020, at 00:49. Investigation into the cause of the failure concluded that the valve was inoperable since its last satisfactory surveillance test completed on May 27, 2020, until restoration on July 28, 2020. Consequently, the required actions and associated completion time of Technical Specification 3.7.8 (A) were not met. 

 This condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B) as a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications. During the time of left train inoperability, the right train remained operable. Therefore, there were no actual consequences to the general safety of the public, nuclear safety, industrial safety or radiological safety for this event.
