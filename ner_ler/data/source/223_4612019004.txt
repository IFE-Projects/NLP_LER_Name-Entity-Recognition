Safety Relief Valve Wiring Issue Results in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On October 2, 2019, at 0200 CDT, at 0% power with the unit shutdown for refueling outage C1R19, while performing Safety Relief Valve (SRV) testing, SRV 1B21-F041B did not open upon demand using the Division 1 Main Control Room (MCR) switch. Further investigation identified that the Division 1 MCR switch for SRV 1621-F041B opened SRV 1B21- F051B and the Division 1 MCR switch for SRV 1B21-F051B opened SRV 1B21-F041B. Initial investigation determined this condition was a Division 1 SRV wiring issue that occurred during refueling outage C1R17 in May 2017. The causes of this event were determined to be imprecise work instructions combined with performance of multiple actions within a single work step in conjunction with lack of adequate signage on SRVs. The Division 1 SRV 1621-F041B and SRV 1B21-F051B wiring was corrected and a post-maintenance test completed. In addition, work order instructions will be revised to incorporate more robust verification practices and SRV signage will be added during the next refueling outage. This condition rendered the Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) function for SRV 1B21-F041B inoperable since May 2017. As a result, Technical Specifications Limiting Condition for Operation 3.5.1, Emergency Core Cooling System - Operating, Action E (One ADS valve inoperable), which requires an inoperable ADS valve be restored within 14 days, was not met. Therefore, the condition described in this Licensee Event Report is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications.
