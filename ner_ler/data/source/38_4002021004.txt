Pressurizer Safety Valve Lift Setpoint Drifted Outside of Technical Specification Tolerance.
 On April 29, 2021, while Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was in Mode 6 for a refueling outage, surveillance testing identified that the lift setting of pressurizer safety valve (PSV) 1RC-123 was -1.3 percent (%) from its setpoint, which is outside the Technical Specification (TS) allowed tolerance of +/-1%. The cause of the PSV lift setting being out of tolerance is a personnel error that resulted in inadvertent installation of a valve that had previously demonstrated setpoint drift incompatible with TS criteria. The PSV was replaced with another PSV confirmed to have a lift setting within the TS allowed tolerance and no history of significant drift. The PSV with a history of significant setpoint drift will be retired from service. 

 The +/-1% TS tolerance is more restrictive than the American Society of Mechanical Engineers code allowed tolerance of +/-3%. In addition, the safety analysis for the PSVs assumes a PSV tolerance of +/- 3%, so the as-found PSV lift setting of -1.3% is well within the safety analysis. Therefore, this event had no significance with respect to the health and safety of the public.
