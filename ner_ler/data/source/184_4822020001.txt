Plant: Wolf Creek.
Plant Shutdown due to Inoperable Containment Purge Isolation Valves.
 On 2/1/2020, while in Mode 1 at 100% power, surveillance testing of containment isolation valves associated with the containment shutdown purge supply piping was being conducted. It was discovered that the leakage rate through the penetration was greater than that allowed by Technical Specifications (TS). Two containment isolation valves in series were determined to be inoperable. This led to entry into TS Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.3 Condition E which requires the plant be in Mode 3 within 6 hours. Due to the high leakage rate, containment was also declared inoperable so Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) entered TS LCO 3.6.1 Condition A which requires restoration of containment to operable status within 1 hour. This was not possible, so TS LCO 3.6.1 Condition B was entered which also requires the plant to be in Mode 3 within 6 hours.

 At 2154 Central Standard Time (CST) on 2/1/2020, WCGS completed a shutdown required by Technical Specifications.Therefore, this is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(A). In addition, because containment was declared inoperable, this is also being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to control the release of radioactive material as well as to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Both valves were returned to service the following day, and WCGS subsequently returned to Mode 1 on 2/3/2020.
