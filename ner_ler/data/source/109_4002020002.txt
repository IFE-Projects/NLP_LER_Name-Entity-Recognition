Manual Reactor Trip due to Control Rod Drop During Surveillance Testing.
 On August 13, 2020 at 09:38 Eastern Daylight Time, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, a control rod dropped during control rod drive (CRD) system surveillance testing. This required a manual reactor trip in accordance with plant procedural guidance. The reactor protection system (RPS) and auxiliary feedwater system (AFWS) actuated as designed. Based upon troubleshooting, it was determined that the control rod drop was due to the accumulation of crud in the dashpot region of the control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) movable gripper latch support assembly, which prevented the stationary gripper from latching onto the CRD shaft when the movable gripper was released. Three full-length exercises for each control rod bank were completed to remove crud from the CRDM surfaces that restored the CRDM to operable for unit startup. The dropped control rod was recovered from the reactor core and restored to the fully withdrawn position. A preventative maintenance activity to exercise the control rod banks 10 steps on a weekly frequency was implemented. Coil current traces will be obtained periodically during rod exercises to monitor for crud presence. After review, the CRD system surveillance test procedure was revised to remove the instruction to trip the reactor if a dropped rod is present with any control rods inserted into the core other than the controlling bank. In the next refueling outage, full length control rod exercises and flushing of applicable CRDMs will be completed. Due to actuation of the RPS and AFWS, this event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv).
