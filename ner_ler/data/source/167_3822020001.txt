Plant: Waterford 3.
Violation of Technical Specification 3.3.3.7.3.a (Broad Range Gas Detection) due to Operators and Maintenance Technicians Not Performing Procedure Step as Intended.
 On 03/18/2020 while performing Chlorine Monitor B Functional and Calibration procedure MI-003-500, the Control Room Outside Air Intake Valves, HVC-101 and HVC-102, unexpectedly opened following a loss of signal. This resulted in taking the control room normal ventilation out of isolate mode. The control room ventilation was required to remain in isolate mode in order to comply with Technical Specification 3.3.3.7.3.a due to an inoperable Broad Range Gas Detector B. The control room ventilation system came out of isolate mode when a control relay was removed as part of the Chlorine Monitor B functional and calibration procedure. This was not an expected response and resulted in an event or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. This occurred because operators and maintenance technicians did not perform a procedure step as intended that would have kept the control room ventilation system in isolate mode. Actions to revise work control documents to include statements to alert workers to this and/or similar potential conditions are being performed. 

 All required safety-related equipment responded as expected during this event.
