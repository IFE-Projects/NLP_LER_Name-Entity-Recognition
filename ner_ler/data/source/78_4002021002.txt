Plant: Harris.
All ECCS Accumulator Isolation Valves Closed in Mode 3 with RCS Pressure Greater Than 1000 psig.
 On December 17, 2020, with Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), in Mode 3, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure was being controlled between 900-1000 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) with all three cold leg accumulator (CLA) discharge valves closed. Only one reactor coolant pump (RCP) was available and operating while RCS pressure was being controlled in manual using a pressurizer spray valve (PSV). With only one RCP in operation, when pressurizer level lowered, pressurizer spray flow became ineffective and RCS pressure began rising at 15:35. Operators took immediate actions to arrest the pressure increase by fully opening the PSV, reducing charging flow, and turning off pressurizer heaters. The RCS pressure rise did not stop prior to exceeding 1000 psig. HNP Technical Specifications (TS) require each CLA to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3 when RCS pressure is greater than 1000 psig. Since all three CLA discharge valves were closed, this TS requirement was not met for approximately 15 minutes, until pressure was reduced to less than 1000 psig. 

 Actions that may be needed for precise RCS pressure control when running the ‘A’ RCP only were not understood or proceduralized, as this condition had not occurred at HNP prior to this event. Procedures will be revised to limit operation of only one RCP and to support adequate pressurizer spray flow during operation of only one RCP when needed. Operators will also receive training on the lessons learned from this event.
