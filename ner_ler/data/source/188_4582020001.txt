Loss of Control Building Chill Water due to Chiller Control Panel Installation Error.
 On January 9, 2020 at 11:32 CST with the reactor at 100% power, a post modification test was performed on Division I Control Building Chilled Water System Chiller A (HVK-CHL1A). During the test, both Division I and Division II Control Building Chilled Water Systems (HVK) were declared Inoperable resulting in a condition that could have prevented fullfilment of a safety function. The event occurred while transferring from operation with HVK Chiller B (HVK-CHL1B) to HVK-CHL1A as part of the test. With HVK-CHL1A in standby, HVK-CHL1B was secured to start the transfer sequence. HVK-CHL1A should have auto started but instead tripped on a Phase Reversal alarm within the digital control logic. An attempt was made to place HVK-CHL1B back in service but it also failed to start rendering both Divisions Inoperable. HVK was restored by placing the alternate Division I Chiller (Chiller 'C') in service and the alternate Division II Chiller (Chiller 'D') in standby approximately 17 minutes after the event. This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). The Environmental Design Criteria maximum temperatures for the critical areas that the HVK system cools were not challenged. Therefore, this event was of minimal significance to the health and safety of the public.
