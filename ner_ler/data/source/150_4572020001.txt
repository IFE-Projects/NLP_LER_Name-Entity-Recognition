Licensee Event Report 2020-001-00 - Three Main Steam Safety Valves Failed Setpoint Testing.
 On April 15 and 16, 2020, pre-outage testing was initiated for the main steam safety valves for setpoint verification per Technical Specification 3.7.1, Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs). During the testing, three of the valves failed to meet the as-found set pressure acceptance criteria. Each valve was inoperable during the test, and the appropriate Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) was in effect at the time. The valves were subsequently adjusted, passed all required as-left requirements, declared Operable and the LCO exited. 

 The apparent cause of the MSSVs as found setpoints being out of tolerance was that a governing document had not been established to formalize best practices for testing and setpoint adjustment of MSSVs, which pre-disposed the valves to larger drift levels over their service time. Corrective actions completed included adjusting the valves to acceptable values during testing and rebuilding the MSSV 2MS016A. Planned corrective actions include scheduling the MSSVs 2MC014B and 2MS016C into the next refueling outage and incorporating best practices into the appropriate processes.
