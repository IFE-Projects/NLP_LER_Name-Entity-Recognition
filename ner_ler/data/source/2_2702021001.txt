2B Motor Driven Emergency Feedwater Pump Past Inoperability Resulted In Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On August 2, 2021 at 0430 EDT, the 2B motor driven emergency feedwater pump (MDEFWP or MDEFW pump) was removed from service for planned train maintenance. Unit 2 was in MODE 1 at 100 percent power. At 1714, the 2B MDEFW pump tripped while starting for a bump for rotation test following completion of planned maintenance. The cause of the 2B MDEFW pump trip was determined to be failure of a shorting block in the secondary circuit of the protective over current relay. The shorting screws on the block had loosened, allowing the circuit to intermittently open, causing arcing, and a distorted current waveform that tripped the protective over current relay. The cause of this event was discovered on August 3, 2021. Following repairs, the 2B MDEFW pump was declared OPERABLE at 2222 on August 4, 2021. 

 A subsequent cause evaluation determined that a similar 2B MDEFW pump trip on February 1, 2021 was also caused by the intermittent poor electrical connection due to the loose shorting screws. Although the 2B MDEFW pump passed the post-maintenance testing in February 2021 and successfully completed a subsequent surveillance in April 2021, the follow-up evaluation determined that the 2B MDEFW pump was inoperable from February 1, 2021 to August 4, 2021; which is longer than the technical specification (TS) limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.7.5, Condition A, seven day allowed outage time. Therefore this condition is being reported as a condition prohibited by TS under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).
