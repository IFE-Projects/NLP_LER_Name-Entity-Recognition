Plant: Duane Arnold.
Notice of Unusual Event and Unit Trip due to Loss of Offsite Power due to High Winds.
 On August 10, 2020, at 1246 CDT, while operating at 80% power, NextEra Energy Duane Arnold (DAEC) experienced a generator load reject and subsequent reactor scram as a result of a loss of offsite power (LOOP) due to extremely high winds. An Unusual Event was declared at 1258. All Safety Systems performed as designed. As a result of the LOOP, the 'A' and 'B' Emergency Diesel Generators automatically started and supplied power to the safety related busses. As a result, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically initiated and injected into the reactor. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50.72 section 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A) - ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) - RPS Actuation - Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) - Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54826). The NOUE was exited at 1600 on August 11, 2020. The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. This event had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) and 50.73(a)(2)(iii). There were no radiological releases associated with this event.
