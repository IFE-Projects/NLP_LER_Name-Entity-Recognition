Inoperability of a TS-required Main Steam Isolation Valve.
 On June 5, 2021, Control Room Operators closed the Main Steam Line C Valves to support the installation of a Temporary Modification. However, the C Inboard Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) [FCV; JM] unexpectedly re-opened after closure. The C Inboard MSIV was declared inoperable upon discovering this condition, since the valve would be unable to close upon receiving a valid PCIS signal. Troubleshooting identified a ground on the C Inboard MSIVâ€™s DC solenoid/wiring [FSV] which caused the DC solenoid to remain energized. The wiring to the valve was modified, and the valve was subsequently declared operable. 

 A Past Operability Evaluation (POE) initially identified an earlier time-of-failure on April 22, 2021, when an Assistant Unit Operator identified a -150 VDC ground on Battery Board [BYBD] 3 [EI] during one of their rounds. 

 The cause of this event was a grounding issue which prevented the de-energization of the DC solenoid which maintains C Inboard MSIV in an open position. This condition persisted because troubleshooting personnel did not fully understand and address the impact of DC grounds and their effects on DC coils. The DC solenoid input wires were lifted and a tagout/clearance was placed to maintain the solenoid in a de-energized state, so that the C Inboard MSIV would close on demand. Although removal of the 250 VDC control power from the solenoid does not conform with BFN UFSAR Chapter 4.6, all TS functions are maintained, and the C Inboard MSIV is capable of meeting all of its required safety functions. The installed TMOD will mitigate adverse effects until the condition can be permanently addressed during the next refueling or maintenance outage.
