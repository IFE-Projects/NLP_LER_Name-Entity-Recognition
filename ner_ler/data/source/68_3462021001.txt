Plant: Davis-Besse.
Emergency Diesel Generator Speed Switch Failure due to Direct Current System Ground.
 On September 4. 2020, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 100 percent power. Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 2 failed to start during scheduled monthly surveillance testing. A failed speed switch was identified and replaced, restoring the EDG to Operable status on September 7, 2020. Because the speed switch failed after only ten months in service, it was shipped to an external vendor for analysis. Based on the vendor analysis conclusion in conjunction with a review of applicable plant data, it was determined on February 12. 2021 that the speed switch was failed on September 1, 2020, due to a shorted component within the switch in conjunction with a ground on the station 125 VDC system. 

 Since the EDG was determined to be failed prior to discovery during routine monthly testing and the necessary Technical Specification actions for an inoperable EDG were not performed based on the time of failure, this event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation of the plant in a condition prohibited by the Technical Specifications.
