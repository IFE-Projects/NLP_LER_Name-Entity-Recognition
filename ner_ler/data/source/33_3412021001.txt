Plant: Fermi 2.
Unrecognized Impact of Opening of Barrier Doors on High Energy Line Break Analysis.
 The Fermi 2 Reactor Building Steam Tunnel (RBST) has a normally closed door which is credited as a hazard barrier for certain high energy line break (HELB) scenarios. On May 3, 2021, while Fermi 2 was operating at 100% reactor power in MODE 1, it was determined that the RBST door had been open on seven occasions within the past three years for longer than required for ingress/egress and that this condition was not bounded by site analyses. If a postulated HELB had occurred while the door was open during those seven occasions, equipment outside the RBST may have been adversely impacted by the post-HELB conditions. It was determined that the conditions were reportable as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS), loss of safety functions, an unanalyzed condition, a common cause inoperability, and a single cause preventing safety functions in different systems. Due to the door being open for only a short time in each case, a bounding risk evaluation determined that the safety significance was very low. There were no radiological releases associated with this event. 

 The cause of this event was the failure of Operations personnel to properly follow site procedures which prohibited the opening of the door (other than during ingress/egress) without prior evaluation by site engineering. Immediate corrective action was taken to restrict opening of the RBST door to ingress/egress only. Additional longer-term corrective actions are planned to perform new HELB analyses that establish specific conditions under which the RBST door may remain open.
