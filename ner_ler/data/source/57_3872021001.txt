Unplanned Inoperability of the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System due to a Primary Containment Isolation (PCIV) Valve Failure to Stroke Full Closed On-demand due to an Intermittent Break in the Close Control Circuitry.
 On March 9, 2021 at approximately 03:13, during performance of quarterly Unit 1 High Pressure Coolant Injection System (HPCI) valve exercising, dual indication was received in the control room for the HPCI Turbine Exhaust Vacuum Breaker inboard isolation valve (HV155F079) due to the valve failing to stroke fully closed on demand. Upon discovery of the condition, Operations entered Unit 1 Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.1.3, Condition A for one or more penetration flow paths with one Primary Containment Isolation Valves (PCIV) inoperable. The HPCI Turbine Exhaust Vacuum Breaker inboard isolation valve was then closed, resulting in unplanned inoperability of HPCI. At the time the condition was identified, Unit 1 was already in TS 3.5.1, Condition D, HPCI system inoperable, due to the planned surveillance testing. 

 This event was reported by Event Notification 55128 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D). The condition is also being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. The cause of the event was an intermittent break in the valve's close control circuitry likely due to dirty contacts on HPCI Turbine Exhaust Vacuum Breaker inboard isolation valve hand switch. Key corrective actions include planned replacement of hand switch (HS15579). There were no actual consequences to the health and safety of the public as a result of this event.
