Plant: Fermi 2.
Secondary Containment Pressure Exceeded Technical Specification due to Reactor Building HVAC Damper Malfunction.
 On September 29, 2019, at 2228 EDT, a planned train swap of the Reactor Building Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (RBHVAC) system resulted in the Technical Specification (TS) for secondary containment (SC) pressure boundary not being met for approximately 2 minutes and 15 seconds. The maximum secondary containment pressure recorded during that time was approximately 0.1 inches of water gauge (positive). Secondary containment pressure was restored to within TS limits by restarting the West RBHVAC train. There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with this event. The cause of this momentary loss of SC was determined to be the effect of the RBHVAC West exhaust fan discharge damper failing to close due to sticking of a time delay relay. For corrective actions, Fermi 2 will replace the relay and has temporarily modified the RBHVAC swap sequence until the relay has been replaced.
