Plant: Beaver Valley 1.
Containment Isolation Valve Found Restrained Open Resulting in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On May 8, 2021, during startup from the 27th Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit 1 (BVPS-1) refueling outage, BVPS-1 entered Mode 4 and then Mode 3 without satisfying Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.3, Containment Isolation Valves, Limiting Conditions for Operation as required by LCO 3.0.1 and LCO 3.0.4. TS 3.6.3 LCO requires containment isolation valves be operable in Modes 1, 2, 3 and 4. TS LCO 3.0.1 requires that LCOs be met during Modes or other specified conditions in the Applicability. TS LCO 3.0.4 requires that with an LCO not met, entry into a Mode of applicability shall only be made when the associated actions to be entered permit continued operation in the Mode for an unlimited period of time or when a risk assessment has been performed determining that entry into the Mode is acceptable. Contrary to LCO 3.0.4, while in Mode 3, it was discovered that containment isolation check valve 1QS-4 (quench spray pump discharge check valve) was inoperable. The check valve was inadvertently left open during performance of a loop seal fill procedure while in Mode 5. 

 The root cause was determined to be a loss of configuration control of 1QS-4 due to human performance errors by the Operations supervisor. The corrective action is to revise the loop fill procedure to direct that the check valves are added to the containment penetration log when being restrained open. This event is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) for operation or condition prohibited by TS.
