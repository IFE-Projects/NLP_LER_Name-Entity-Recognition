Component Cooling Water System Train A Inoperable Longer than Allowed by Technical Specifications.
 On June 17, 2019, at 1723 eastern daylight time (EDT), a temporary modification was implemented on the Essential Raw Cooling Water (ERCW) System. The purpose of the modification was to swap the function of two valves in the ERCW System because the function of one valve was determined to be degraded. Ordinarily, one of the valves could be controlled and throttled from the Main Control Room. Various throttling positions are used to allow operational flexibility for ERCW flow rates, while allowing the valve to be quickly placed in throttled positions to satisfy the ERCW flow balance requirements for accident alignments. During the flush of a Component Cooling Water System (CCS) heat exchanger on August 24, 2019, one of the valves was placed in a throttled position determined as part of the temporary modification. Shortly after beginning the flush, CCS alarms were received in the MCR which caused operators to terminate the flush and restore ERCW flows. Section XI test data were evaluated and it was determined that the throttled positions implemented by the modification did not allow the required flow. On August 28, 2019, a flow balance test was conducted and the correct positions were determined. The event rendered Unit 2 A Train of the CCS inoperable for longer than allowed by Technical Specifications.

 The cause of this event is the failure to adequately recognize the risk of relying on an indirect method to determine the throttle valve positions. Corrective actions include completing a required reading and lessons learned for the Engineering Department regarding the event and the circumstances associated with the event.
