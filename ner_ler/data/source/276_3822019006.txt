Unplanned Loss of Both Trains of Broad Range Gas Monitors Results in a Condition that Could Have Prevented Fulfillment of a Safety Function.
 On June 25, 2019, at 0428, Waterford 3 declared both Broad Range Gas Monitor (BRGM) channels inoperable and the control room emergency air filtration system was manually placed in isolate mode at 0441 to comply with the 1-hr action requirement of Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.3.7.3, "Broad Range Gas Detection." With both BRGM channels declared inoperable, TS 3.7.6.1, "Control Room Emergency Air Filtration," was not met. For the 13 minutes prior to the control room being manually isolated, the Control Room Envelope Boundary was inoperable, resulting in an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function.

 The root cause of the event was that the Broad Range Gas Monitoring System is not designed to automatically isolate the Control Room Envelope for conditions resulting in a Toxic Gas Monitor Trouble Alarm. Actions were completed to restore both trains of BRGMs to operable status and issue a Standing Instruction to preventively isolate Control Room ventilation during BRGM or Chlorine Monitor outages. Planned actions are to complete a design modification that would isolate the control room emergency filtration system upon the receipt of a toxic gas monitoring trouble alarm.
