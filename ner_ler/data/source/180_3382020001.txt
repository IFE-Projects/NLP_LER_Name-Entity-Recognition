Degraded Upper Cylinder Piston Pin Bushing Discovered during Maintenance Activities on Emergency Diesel Generator.
 On February 18, 2020 at approximately 0359, brass shavings were discovered on the upper crankcase of the 1J Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) during planned maintenance activities. Maintenance activities further revealed degradation of the number one upper piston pin bushing. The piston pin bushing was replaced. The 1J EDG satisfactorily completed its return to service testing and was restored to operable status on 02/26/2020 at 1925. Investigation into the cause of failure concluded this condition occurred during the start of the 1J EDG test on 01/22/2020 impacting its ability to meet its 30-day mission time. The 1J EDG was conservatively determined to be inoperable since its last satisfactory test completed on 12/16/2019. Since 12/16/2019, the 1H EDG was inoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately 39.5 hours. This results in 1J and 1H EDG being inoperable concurrently corresponding to an event that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)). A Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications (T.S.) is also reported due to 1J EDG inoperability and concurrent inoperability with 1H EDG greater than T.S. allowed outage times (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)). There were no actual safety consequences due to this event. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.
