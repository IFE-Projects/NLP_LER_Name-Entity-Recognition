Phase to Ground Fault in Isolated Phase Bus Duct Led to Generator Trip and an Automatic SCRAM.
 On August 25, 2019, at 1102 hours CDT, Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station (QCNPS) Unit 1 experienced an automatic reactor SCRAM from 100 percent power. The SCRAM was the result of a generator trip that occurred when leakage current measured by the Generator Stator Ground Detection Relay exceeded its threshold and actuated the Generator Primary Lock Out Relay (86 Device). Following the Reactor SCRAM, water was found in the "A" Isolated Phase Bus Duct (IPBD) between the Unit Aux Transformer (UAT) and the wall of the Turbine Building. It was determined that water entered through a degraded access cover gasket located on the IPBD and the resulting condensation within the duct caused current leakage through one or more of the insulators that support the bus. The corrective actions include replacement of the insulators that were impacted by the water, replacing the degraded gaskets and implementing additional preventative maintenance activities on the IPBD system.

 This is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for an event or condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the reactor protection system (RPS) and containment isolation signals for Groups 2 and 3 affecting containment isolation valves in more than one system.
