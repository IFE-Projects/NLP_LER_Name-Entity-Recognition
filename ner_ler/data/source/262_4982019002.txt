Plant: South Texas 1.
Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications and Loss of Safety Function due to Inoperable Reactor Head Vent Throttle Valves.
 On December 31, 2018, South Texas Project (STP) Unit 1 reactor vessel head vent throttle valve (RHVTV) 'A' was declared INOPERABLE. On July 30, 2019, STP Unit 1 RHVTV 'B' was declared INOPERABLE. Technical Specifications requires one RHVTVs to be OPERABLE. With two INOPERABLE RHVTVs, entry into a 30-day Technical Specification shutdown ACTION statement is required. The RHVTVs could have been prevented from fulfilling a safety function needed to maintain the reactor in a safe shutdown condition, mitigating a possible condition of inadequate core cooling or impaired natural circulation. Operations did not recognize the loss of safety function and did not request a reportability review as required by station procedure. 

 On July 31, 2019, following additional investigation, STP Nuclear Operating Company determined that RHVTV 'B' had been INOPERABLE since June 24, 2019. Therefore, the RHVTV was INOPERABLE for longer than the Technical Specification 30-day shutdown ACTION statement, resulting in a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. On August 1, 2019, RHVTV 'B' was declared OPERABLE. On August 15, 2019, RHVTV 'A' was declared OPERABLE. The event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates, and there were no personnel injuries or damage to any safety-related equipment associated with this event. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public.
