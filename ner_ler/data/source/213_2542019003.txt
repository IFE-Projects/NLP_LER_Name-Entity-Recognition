Plant: Quad Cities 2.
Water Found in Control Room Emergency Ventilation Air Filtration Unit.
 On October 27, 2019, at 1605 hours CDT, the Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station (QCNPS) Unit 1 and Unit 2 Control Room Emergency Ventilation (CREV) system was declared inoperable due to finding water in the Air Filtration Unit (AFU) filter housing. Water leaked into the B CREV AFU through an air operated fire suppression system isolation valve and sprinkler heads internal to the AFU resulting in partial submersion of the AFU filters. Maintenance on the isolation valve actuator on October 10, 2019, did not include post-maintenance testing, which resulted in inadvertently leaving the valve in a condition that provided a path for leakage into the AFU. 

 The cause of the event was an absence of adequate work instructions for the performance of effective post-maintenance testing. Immediate Corrective actions completed include replacement of the AFU filters. Followup Corrective actions include a repair of the valve, and improvements to the model work order.

 This is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications, for the CREV system being inoperable longer than the seven (7) days allowed by Technical Specification 3.7.4, "Control Room Emergency Ventilation (CREV) System." It is also being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
