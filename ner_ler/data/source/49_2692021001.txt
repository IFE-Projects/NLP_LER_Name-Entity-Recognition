Plant: Oconee 3.
Plant Protected Area Security Vulnerability Discovered Without Compensatory Security Measures.
 On April 1, 2021, at 1215 EDT, with all three Units in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, Oconee Nuclear Station personnel discovered an uncompensated security vulnerability that could have allowed unauthorized or undetected access into the protected area (PA). Compensatory actions were promptly established and an immediate investigation was conducted that did not reveal any evidence of unauthorized entry or tampering. At 1630 EDT it was determined that a 1-hour report was required for this condition. The 1-hour report (EN55166) was made at 1730 EDT. The causes are attributed to the omission of relevant information in a new test procedure and inadequate work order task instructions which failed to ensure proper reconnection of equipment following the performance of a manual failover. The vulnerability was the result of authorized work. No unauthorized access to the protected area (PA) occurred during the time period that the vulnerability existed. This event did not have any nuclear or personal safety implications. 

 This 60-day written report is submitted in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 73.71(b), which refers to 10 CFR 73 Appendix G, "Reportable Safeguards Events," Section I(c), and 10 CFR 73.71(d).
