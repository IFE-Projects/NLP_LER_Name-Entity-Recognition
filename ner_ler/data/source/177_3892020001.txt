Plant: St. Lucie 2.
Turbine Loss of Load Trip Found Outside Technical Specification Allowable Range due to Unspecified Legacy M&TE or Calibration Deficiencies.
 On February 22, 2020, St. Lucie Unit 2 was in Mode 6 for the SL2-25 refueling outage. During performance of the periodic outage calibration of the reactor protection system (RPS) turbine loss of load pressure switches, the as-found trip setpoint value for all four channels were outside the Technical Specification (TS) allowable values. The subject pressure switches were recalibrated, tested satisfactorily, and returned to service.

 The actual cause of the event was indeterminate. The most likely match for the observed condition was inadequate calibration of the pressure instruments due to either legacy M&TE or calibration deficiencies. Corrective actions are planned to revise the calibration procedures to require replacement of any pressure switches requiring large adjustments. 

 Reactor Trip on Turbine Trip is not credited for reactor safety. It is an equipment protection trip. Additionally, the as-found setpoints would have had no measureable impact on RPS performance during a postulated turbine trip. Therefore, this event had no impact on the health and safety of the public.
