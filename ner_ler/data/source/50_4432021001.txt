Pressurizer Safety Valve Outside of Technical Specification Limits Discovered During As-Found Set Point Testing.
 On March 25, 2021, with Seabrook Station at 100% power, it was determined that one of the three Pressurizer Safety Valves (PSVs) had a low as-found set point pressure which was discovered during off site testing after the valve was removed from service during the previous refueling outage (04/01/20). Technical Specifications (TS) require three pressurizer safety valves to be operable, with a lift setting of +/- 3% in Modes 1, 2, and 3. One safety valve had an as-found set point of -4.2%, the other two were within the +/- 3% allowable tolerance. The cause of the set point pressure being out of the allowable band is attributed to set point drift. The planned Corrective Action is to replace the spring. Following the spring replacement, additional testing will be performed to ensure the valve will be suitable for continued service.
