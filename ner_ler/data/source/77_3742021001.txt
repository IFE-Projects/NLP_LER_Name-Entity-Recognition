High Pressure Core Spray Inoperable due to Water Leg Pump Breaker Cubicle Motor Contactor.
 On December 23, 2020, the Unit 2 high pressure core spray (HPCS) water leg pump (WLP) tripped off due to a fault within its breaker cubicle. The HPCS WLP is a support component required to maintain the HPCS system operable. With the loss of the WLP, the HPCS system was declared inoperable. The unit entered applicable technical specification required actions to immediately verify that the reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was operable and to restore the HPCS system to operable within 14 days. 

 This condition was previously reported under emergency notification system (ENS) 55046 as a single-train system inoperability that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function used to mitigate an accident. The condition is being reported under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. The system was restored to operable following replacement of the affected HPCS WLP breaker cubicle control power transformer and motor contactor. The cause was age-related failure of the breaker cubicle motor contactor.
