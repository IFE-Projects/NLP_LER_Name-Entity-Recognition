Plant: Pilgrim.
Manual Reactor Scram due to Degrading Condenser Vacuum.
 On Friday, May 17, 2019 at 2303 [EDT], with the reactor at approximately 70% core thermal power, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station initiated a manual reactor scram due to degrading condenser vacuum as a result of the trip of Seawater Pump B. Investigation into the cause identified the Seawater Pump B breaker ground sensing relay in the tripped state. 

 Following the Seawater Pump B trip and reactor scram, Main Condenser parameters responded as expected to a loss of seawater pump transient, no anomalies were noted. There were no radiological releases due to this event. All control rods inserted fully. All other plant systems responded as designed. 

 This event had no impact on the health and/or safety of the public.
