Plant: Salem 1.
Salem Unit 1 Manual Reactor Trip and Auxiliary Feed Water System Actuation.
 At 0056 on 3/25/2020, with Unit 1 at 17 percent power during a plant return from a scheduled refueling outage, the reactor was manually tripped due to a failure of the 11 Rod Control Motor Generator due to a malfunction of its associated Voltage Regulator. All systems responded normally post-trip. An actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater system occurred following the manual reactor trip as expected due to low level in the steam generators. The unit was stabilized in Mode 3. 

 The failed equipment was repaired. 

 This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).
