Plant: Waterford 3.
Plant Shutdown Required by Technical Specifications due to Charging Pump Suction Line Flaw.
 On June 30, 2019, at 2112 Central Daylight Time, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) unidentified leakage experienced a step increase from 0.02 gpm to 0.24 gpm. During the subsequent leak investigation, leakage was identified in a Chemical and Volume Control (CVC) system drain line upstream of valve CVC-186. CVC-186 provides a drain path from the Volume Control Tank and Charging Pump suction header to the Equipment Drain Tank. This line is on the suction path to all three charging pumps and is part of the boration flow path to the Charging Pumps. 

 Radiography was performed and determined that the line had a 1.162-inch-long circumferential flaw. The flaw was located on the approximate 1/8-inch exposed portion of the line between weld toes. Analysis was performed and determined that the maximum allowable flaw size for the piping configuration was 1.7 inches. Daily monitoring of the piping flaw was established. On 7/31/2019, the flaw size was measured to be 1.75 inches. The flaw growth resulted in all three Charging Pumps and the associated boration flow path being inoperable. Operations entered Technical Specification 3.0.3 and commenced a plant shutdown. Repairs were attempted in Mode 3 but were unsuccessful. The plant entered Mode 5 and replaced the damaged section of pipe. After the repairs were completed the system was successfully returned to service.
