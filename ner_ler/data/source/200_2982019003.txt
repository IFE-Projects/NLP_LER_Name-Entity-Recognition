Division 2 Service Water Discharge Blockage Resulting in Unplanned Service Water Inoperability.
 On December 5, 2019, while attempting to place Reactor Equipment Cooling Heat Exchanger B in service, Service Water flow to the heat exchanger was unable to be established. Reactor Equipment Cooling Subsystem B was declared Inoperable at 02:15 on December 6, 2019 following validation of the condition. On December 8, 2019, troubleshooting determined the flow blockage was on the common buried Division 2 Service Water piping downstream of Diesel Generator 2, Reactor Equipment Cooling Heat Exchanger B, and Residual Heat Removal Heat Exchanger B. Service Water Subsystem B and Diesel Generator 2 were declared Inoperable at 05:00 on December 8, 2019. 

 Manual sounding of the discharge canal was performed to determine the sediment levels above the Division 2 Service Water pipe outfall. The sounding identified approximately 15 feet of sediment. A Work Order was prepared for removing the sediment by dredging the discharge canal. Dredging commenced on December 12, 2019. Within one hour, Service Water flow was established through the Division 2 outfall. Dredging continued to remove sediment from around the Division 2 outfall, then proceeded to remove sediment from around the Division 1 outfall. A Compensatory Measure was implemented to maintain continuous Service Water flow from the outfalls above 1000 gallons per minute (gpm). Operability was restored at 05:00 on December 13, 2019.
