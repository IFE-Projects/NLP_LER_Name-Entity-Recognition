Potential Loss of Safety Function for all ADS (Automatic Depressurization System) Valves.
 On 24 October 2019, the Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) air supply header pressure began to lower. This header provides air for the automatic or manual operation of the Safety Relief Valves (SRV's) from the Control Room. A loss of header pressure was caused by leaking Air Operated Valves (AOV's) on the 'B' Train Dryer of ADS which was worked on during a scheduled maintenance window. When a tagout was removed on the 'B' Train ADS AOV's, header pressure began to lower. Attempting to control header pressure, the 'A' Train ADS Safety Vent Valve (SVV) Compressor (SVV-C4A) tripped on a thermal overload. This trip was due to excessive start/stops caused by the air leak on the 'B' Train Dryer ADS AOV's. During this time the 'B' Train compressor, SVV-C48, was still tagged out for maintenance. The tagout for SVV-C48 was then removed and the compressor started, but header pressure continued to lower. Maintenance personnel were dispatched to assist Operations to investigate why header pressure continued to lower. SVV-C4A was reset and started and SVV-C4B secured. ADS header pressure then recovered to its normal operating pressure. 

 Seven SRV's were declared inoperable due to ADS header pressure lowering below the Technical Specification limit of 131 psig. This required entry into a 12-hour shutdown LCO. Approximately 40 minutes after the LCO was entered, header pressure recovered and the LCO was exited.
