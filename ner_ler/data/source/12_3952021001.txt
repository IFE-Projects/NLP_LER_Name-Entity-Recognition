Plant: Summer 1.
Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 In 2010, Nuclear Logistics (NLI) was contracted by V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) to replace its 3 safety-related chillers. On June 28, 2021, V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) was notified that the bolted diagonal supports for the NLI safety related chillers (XHX0001A/1B/1C) have a bolt (the pin) which would not withstand the combined design seismic and thermal loads. The vendor conclusion was confirmed by VCSNS personnel. As a result, the previous NLI chiller support frame design does not meet required seismic qualification under VCSNS procurement specification for compliance with 10 CFR 50 Appendix A, Criterion 2. At the time of discovery, only the 'A' Chiller had been replaced. Additional support bracing was designed, fabricated, and installed for the affected in-service 'A' Chiller. The enhanced bracing installation has corrected the issue and restored compliance with Technical Specifications (TS). There were no seismic events of consequence to the 'A' Chiller functionality during the time of the deficient seismic restraint (February 17, 2017 until June 29, 2021). However, there were times when the 'A' Chiller was credited as a TS support component, resulting in the plant operating in a condition prohibited by TS.
