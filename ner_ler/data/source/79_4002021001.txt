Automatic Reactor Trip due to Faults on Non-Segregated Bus from Unit Auxiliary Transformer 1B.
 On December 16, 2020, at 08:51, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP) experienced an automatic reactor trip due to lock-out of the main generator. The generator lock-out was triggered by phase-to-phase faults that occurred on the 6.9 kilovolt non-segregated bus from the Unit Auxiliary Transformer 1B to the Auxiliary Bus 1B. 

 Based on forensics and causal analysis, the event was initiated by electrical faults impacting the non-segregated bus within a wall penetration between the Turbine Building (TB) and the Reactor Auxiliary Building (RAB). Degraded bus insulation (Noryl) combined with a medium to conduct the current (water) resulted in faults on the bus. The bus within the penetration is inaccessible and insulation had not been proactively replaced despite known degradation mechanisms. In addition, the installed configuration of the wall penetration did not match the original design and was not being maintained to ensure weather tight characteristics. Bus insulation will be replaced to ensure ongoing insulation integrity and bus penetrations will be restored to design configuration. Further actions will be taken to emphasize lessons learned from the event, including the need to proactively address known issues.
