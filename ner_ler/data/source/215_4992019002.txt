Incorrect Sequencer Part Replacement Leads to Undervoltage Signal and Valid Actuation of Emergency Diesel Generator.
 During a maintenance activity on October 24, 2019, a 24V opto-isolator module was installed in the Unit 2 C-Train Load Sequencer (Sequencer 2C) instead of the required 125V module. Due to the installation and subsequent failure of this incorrect part, Sequencer 2C initiated an electrical bus strip signal and the C-Train 4.16kV bus was deenergized. Consequently, an undervoltage signal was sent to Sequencer 2C which then sent a valid Engineered Safety Features (ESF) actuation signal to Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 23. The C-Train ESF loads were shed but EDG 23 did not automatically start because it had been placed in Pull-To-Stop to support Sequencer 2C maintenance activities. EDG was taken out of Pull-To-Stop by the Control Room staff to allow it to auto start and load the bus. This event is reportable as an event that resulted in the automatic actuation of an emergency AC electrical power system. Corrective actions planned include work guideline changes, personnel briefings, and updates to the STP master parts list.

 The event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates and there were no personnel injuries or damage to any safety-related equipment associated with this event. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public.
