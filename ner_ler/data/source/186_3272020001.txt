Containment Vacuum Relief Lines Found Isolated.
 On January 21, 2020, at 2218 Eastern Standard Time (EST) Operations Personnel identified that 3-out-of-3 containment vessel vacuum relief isolation valves were isolated. Operations Personnel declared the containment vessel vacuum relief lines inoperable. Operations Personnel restored the vacuum relief lines to operable status at 2223 EST by opening the vacuum relief isolation valves. Investigation of the condition determined that while in a refueling outage on November 13, 2019, a Licensed Operator incorrectly closed the vacuum relief isolation valves during the performance of a surveillance instruction. The cause of the event was a failure to follow the surveillance instruction by the Licensed Operator. The Operator assumed that a process was in place to restore the valves to open position. It was also determined that Operations Leadership did not establish a rigorous outage oversight plan, which precluded the ability to identify degraded or declining operator fundamental behavior. Actions being taken to address this event include a formal oversight plan to reinforce use of Operator Fundamentals, monitoring for shortfalls, and coaching to standards. Also, a revision to the common operating procedure for unit startup will ensure the vacuum relief system is aligned for Mode 4 entry.
