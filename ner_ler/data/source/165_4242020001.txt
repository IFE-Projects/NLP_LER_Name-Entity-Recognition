Safety-Related Electrical Bus Deenergizing Results in Emergency Diesel Generator Start Signal.
 At 1644 EDT, on March 21, 2020, with Unit 1 in Mode 6, at 000 percent power, approximately 83 degrees Fahrenheit, and depressurized, an actuation of the Unit 1 B-Train Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) occurred during Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) testing. The reason for the EDG auto-start signal was a loss of voltage on the Bravo train, safety related, electrical bus due to the EDG output breaker opening. The EDG output breaker opened due to a Human Performance Error when testing steps were performed out of order. The causes were lack of adherence to accepted procedure use standards and ineffective oversight. The corrective actions include revisions to the ESFAS testing procedures to add clarifying direction on the order of procedure step performance and for resetting the EDG lockout relay and safety injection signal, and dynamic learning activities and oral boards will be performed to verify proper supervisor oversight proficiency. 

 The EDG was already running at the time of the loss of voltage on the bus. Due to the automatic actuation of systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B), specifically the Emergency Diesel Generator System, this event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). The operating crew responded correctly to the event. The applicable abnormal operating procedures were properly entered, and documentation met expectations.
