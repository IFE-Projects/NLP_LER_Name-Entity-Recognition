Core Spray System Inoperable for Longer than Permitted by Technical Specifications.
 On July 1, 2020, the motor thermal overloads associated with the 2A Core Spray Room Cooler Fan were found tripped during a surveillance test. The breaker was not tripped, and was found still in the "on" position. Operators reset the thermal overloads, which restarted the room cooler fans without resetting the breaker. The thermal overloads were replaced on July 2, 2020. 

 After a recurrent trip on July 6, 2020, troubleshooting determined that mechanical binding within the motor sporadically increased the running current, which tripped the thermal overloads. An engineering evaluation later determined that the non-functional Core Spray Room Cooler Fan rendered the Loop I Core Spray subsystem inoperable from May 29, 2020 until July 12, 2020, which is longer than allowed by Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.1, “Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) -- Operating”. On June 13, 2020 a planned surveillance rendered the Loop II Core Spray System inoperable. This resulted in a period of time with both Loops I and II of the Core Spray System concurrently inoperable resulting in a Safety System Functional Failure (SSFF) of systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. As a corrective action, the motor, thermal overloads, temperature switch, and starter coil were replaced. 

 As a corrective action to prevent recurrence, BFN is creating a new Preventative Maintenance (PM) to measure the motor current readings to the thermal overloads every two years, during the summer months when the fan is in high use. This will detect possible changes in continuous running current prior to overcurrent trips or motor damage.
