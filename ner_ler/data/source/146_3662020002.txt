Plant: Hatch 2.
HPCI and RCIC inoperable When Required by Technical Specifications.
 At 1015 EST, on 04/22/2020, while Unit 2 was at approximately 0.4 percent power in MODE 2 reactor steam dome pressure reached and subsequently exceeded 150 psig while High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) were inoperable due to not being placed in standby. Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Conditions of Operation (LCO) 3.5.1 and 3.5.3 are applicable in Mode 2, when Reactor steam dome pressure is greater than 150 psig. TS LCO 3.5.1. Conditions C and E were entered. TS LCO 3.5.3 Conditions A and B were also entered. HPCI does not have a redundant system therefore, this condition is being reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. Contrary to the requirements of LCO 3.0.4. LCO 3.5.1 and LCO 3.5.3 were not met before entering the mode of applicability. Therefore, this event is also being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by technical specifications. The Automatic Depressurization System and Low Pressure Emergency Core Cooling system were OPERABLE during this time. HPCI was returned to OPERABLE status at 1109 EST on 04/22/2020. RCIC was returned to operable status at 1143 EST on 04/22/2020. This event was caused a by human performance error. There was no impact on the health and safety of the public or plant personnel.
