Oscillation Power Range Monitors (OPRMs) Count Setpoint Discrepancy Due to Inadequate Instructions.
 On July 22, 2020 during the performance of an Oscillation Power Range Monitor (OPRM) time test it was identified that the as-found OPRM maximum confirmation count setpoint on the Unit 2 OPRMs did not match the values in the Quad Cities Unit 2 Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). All Unit 2 OPRMS were declared inoperable at 1030 on July 22, 2020. Operations entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1.3 Condition A for OPRMs 1-8 and Condition B for loss of trip capability. The setpoint discrepancy was corrected and all the Unit 2 OPRMs were declared operable on July 23, 2020 at 1210. TS 3.3.1.3 Condition A and Condition B were exited at that time.

 The cause of the incorrect OPRM count setpoint was due to insufficient work package guidance and a lack of verification to ensure that the work instructions contained the proper setpoints. 

 This is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), operation or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii), common cause inoperability of independent trains or channels. No 10 CFR 50.72 report was made for this event.
