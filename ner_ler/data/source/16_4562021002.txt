Unit Trip on Generator Load Rejection due to Lightning Strike Within the Unit Switchyard Exceeding the Capabilities of the Switchyard Grounding System.
 On June 21, 2021 at 0051 hours, Unit 1 experienced an automatic reactor trip due to a generator lockout relay actuation and subsequent turbine trip and reactor trip. 
The cause of the event was determined to be due to a lightning strike within the unit switchyard exceeding the capabilities of the switchyard grounding system, which resulted in induced voltage on the 125 Volt DC load rejection circuit for the Unit 1 generator output breakers. Planned corrective actions are to conduct a study of the grounding system and implement appropriate approved upgrades to the station and switchyard grounding grid to reduce the impact of future lightning strikes. 
 This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, ..." Specifically, for 1) 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1) for the "Reactor protection system (RPS) including: reactor scram or reactor trip," and 2) 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6) for the "PWR auxiliary or emergency feedwater system."
