Multiple Trains of RHRSW Inoperable for Greater than Time Allowed by Technical Specifications due to Pipe Corrosion.
 On 7/11/19 a pin hole leak was identified on the 18-inch distribution piping of the C Spray Network while the spray network was in operation for Spray Pond cooling. Subsequent NDE inspections identified wall thinning over a large arc of the piping's circumference; approximately 34 feet of piping required replacement. On 08/25/19, the extent of condition inspection of the A Spray Network identified similar corrosion damage. The condition was determined to be reportable for a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications and a common cause inoperability of independent trains. All four Spray Networks were inspected, and corrosion damage was identified on all four of the Spray Networks' 18-inch distribution piping.

 Although the 18-inch spray network distribution piping was degraded, the spray networks and the ultimate heat sink were determined to be functional. The cause of the pipe corrosion damage observed on the 18-inch distribution piping of each spray pond spray network was flow-induced film removal accompanied by high humidity electrochemical atmospheric corrosion. This condition was not identified prior to the piping becoming inoperable because there was a lack of understanding of this potential failure mechanism. The affected piping was replaced and an NDE inspection and proactive pipe replacement strategy will be established to ensure long term reliability of the above ground spray pond spray network piping.
