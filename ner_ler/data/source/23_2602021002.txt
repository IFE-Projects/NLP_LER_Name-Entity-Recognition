Main Steam Relief Valves Lift Settings Outside of Technical Specifications Required Setpoints.
 On June 3, 2021, the Tennessee Valley Authority was notified of As-Found testing results that five Main Steam Relief Valves (MSRVs) from Unit 2 were outside the +/- 3 percent set-point band required for operability. 

 More than the one allowed MSRV was considered to be inoperable during the entire operating cycle and longer than permitted by Technical Specifications. During this time, BFN Unit 2 made entries into Modes of Operation that were not allowed under this condition. The affected valves remained capable of maintaining reactor pressure within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers code limits. 

 It was determined that one MSRV failed due to corrosion bonding between the pilot valve disc and seat, and the other four failed due to setpoint spring relaxation. As a corrective action, the MSRV maintenance procedure will be revised to include stricter testing and acceptance criteria for pilot setpoint spring parameters based on industry best-practices. This stricter testing criteria will drive spring replacement prior to a point of relaxation which results in as-found setpoint testing failures. Additionally, all thirteen of the MSRV pilot valves were replaced during the Unit 2 Spring 2021, refueling outage with pilot discs coated in platinum utilizing the Plasma Enhanced Magnetron Sputtering (PEMS) deposition method. PEMS provides a more consistent finish on the pilot valve seating surface and gives the platinum more inherent ductility than what the previous deposition method provided. BFN began using the PEMS method in 2019, so the valves involved in this event did not receive PEMS deposited platinum coatings during their last rebuild. The PEMS method was used for the pilot discs of the rebuilt valves installed during the Unit 2 Spring 2021 refueling outage, and will be used for all pilot discs going forward.
