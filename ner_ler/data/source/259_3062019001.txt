Reactor Coolant Isolation Valve Leakage Results in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On August 1, 2019 at 0935, Unit 2 control room received a high rate of change alarm from containment radiation monitors. At the time, station personnel were performing Reactor Coolant System (RCS) sampling. Once the evolution was completed, containment radiation levels decreased to levels observed prior to sampling. Sampling of containment atmosphere found the presence of Argon-41 indicating that the source of the increased radiation levels was from the RCS. A review of system lineup and components found that the most likely source of the increased radiation levels was MV-32410, the reactor coolant loop B hot leg sample inboard isolation valve. Indications are that the seat itself is not leaking but that damage to an internal diaphragm allowed RCS to vent to containment. MV-32410 and MV-32411, reactor coolant loop B hot leg sample outboard isolation valve, are in series primary containment isolation valves for a single penetration. The probable damage to the valve was not identified until August 7, 2019. Per Technical Specification 3.6.3, if a penetration flow path with two primary containment isolation valves is inoperable, isolate the penetration flow path by use of at least one closed and de-activated valve, closed manual valve, blind flange, or check valve within 4 hours. If this condition is not met, Condition F requires the unit to be in Mode 3 within six hours and Mode 5 within 36 hours. As a result, this was a condition prohibited by technical specifications because these conditions were not met.
