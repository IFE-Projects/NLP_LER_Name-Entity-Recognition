Plant: Fermi 2.
Valid Actuation of Emergency Diesel Generators During Partial Loss of Offsite Power.
 At 2305 EDT on July 1, 2020, while in Mode 5 for Refueling Outage 20, Fermi 2 experienced a loss of Division 2 offsite power (345 kV). The loss of Division 2 offsite power resulted in a valid automatic initiation of the Division 2 Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs 13 and 14) as designed. EDGs 13 and 14 started as expected and successfully supplied their associated busses. The plant experienced a trip of the 345kV Switchyard during RF20 when mayflies overwhelmed the insulators during a hatch. The 345 kV switchyard lighting was turned off but there was still sufficient light from the adjacent light poles that attracted the mayflies to the 345 kV switchyard components. Actions were taken to minimize the potential for future switchyard operations being impacted from mayflies. Area lighting where the event occurred were deenergized. Additionally, temporary portable lights were strategically located to draw the mayflies away from the plant equipment. The seasonal mayfly control procedure has been updated to reflect these changes. Guidance was provided for monitoring and recommended actions if a future infestation event is identified. This is currently evaluated in an Operational Decision Making Document. An 8-hour event notification (EN 54761) was made to the NRC based on meeting the reporting criteria of Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) as an event or condition that resulted in valid actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B).
