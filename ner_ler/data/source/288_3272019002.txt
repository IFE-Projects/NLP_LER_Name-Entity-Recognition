Steam Generator Pressure Transmitter Degraded Sensing Line Causes Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.
 On April 15, 2019, during a post trip review, it was identified that Steam Generator #3 pressure transmitter, 1-PT-1-23, had demonstrated sluggish behavior during the transient. The pressure input is utilized by the Engineered Safety Features Actuation System for several postulated events. Operations declared the instrument inoperable, and entered the appropriate Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) until maintenance activities restored operability. Investigation revealed that the instrument response exceeded the TS channel check acceptance criteria. Historical search and past operability evaluation completed May 29, 2019, determined that previous identification was not effectively resolved, and that there were multiple periods where other transmitters were removed from service at the same time as the affected transmitter. This led to a condition prohibited by TS, and a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function. The cause of the component failure was debris found in the pressure transmitter sensing line due to a lack of regularly scheduled preventative maintenance. The corrective action is to ensure preventative maintenance instructions are created to clear sensing lines for Main Steam transmitters.
