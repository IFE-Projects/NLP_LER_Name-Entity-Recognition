Plant: Sequoyah 2.
Ice Bed Inoperable due to Exceeding Maximum Allowed Ice Bed Temperature.
 On July 23, 2020, at 1920 eastern daylight time, the SQN Unit 2 Main Control Room received an unexpected glycol expansion tank low level alarm, followed by a low-low level alarm at 1928. An auxiliary unit operator was dispatched to investigate and discovered the Auxiliary Glycol Cooling System (AGCS) skid was leaking glycol through a flanged connection. The AGCS was aligned for Unit 2 ice bed cooling, in lieu of plant installed chillers, as part of an engineering design change to replace the ice bed glycol chillers. Upon discovery, Operations took action to secure and isolate the AGCS from the Unit 2 ice bed cooling loop and aligned the plant installed chillers to the Unit 2 ice bed. However, at 0105, on July 24, the Unit 2 ice bed was declared inoperable due to exceeding the maximum ice bed temperature of</= 27 degrees Fahrenheit (F) for Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.12.1. At 0833, the Unit 2 ice bed maximum temperature decreased below 27 degrees F. Unit 2 exited TS 3.6.12, Condition A for the inoperable ice bed.

 The cause of the event was the failure of a gasket on vendor supplied equipment at the flanged connection on the AGCS skid. The corrective action for this event was to repair the AGCS skid.
