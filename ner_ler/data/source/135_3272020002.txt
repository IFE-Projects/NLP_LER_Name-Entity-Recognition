Plant: Sequoyah 1.
Safety Injection Signal with Reactor Trip Caused by a Failure with the Main Turbine Control System.
 On May 13, 2020, at 0208 eastern daylight time, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, was at 100 percent power when an automatic reactor trip signal was received concurrent with a low steam line pressure safety injection signal. The low steam line pressure safety injection signal was actuated from the steam rate of decrease feature. Following the reactor trip, all plant safety systems responded as designed with the exception of the following components: Pressure Transmitter, 1-PT-1-23, was found to have a failed power supply and Glycol Inboard Isolation Valve, 1-FCV-61-122, failed to automatically isolate on the Phase A containment isolation signal (the corresponding outboard isolation valve actuated as designed such that the penetration was isolated, as required). A post-trip troubleshooting team determined that the cause of the event was the failure of a Speed Error Channel B card associated with the Analog Electro-Hydraulic (AEH) Control System for the Main Turbine. The card was replaced, calibrated, and successfully passed functional testing. 

 The failure of the Speed Error Amplifier B Card was caused by a failed chip on the card identified because of an over heated resistor. The corrective action to reduce similar events is to replace the Main Turbine AEH Control System.
