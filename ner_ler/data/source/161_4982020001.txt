Plant: South Texas 1.
Automatic Actuation of Emergency Diesel Generators due to Lockout of Switchyard Electrical Bus.
 On March 24, 2020 with Unit 1 defueled and Unit 2 at 100% power, the South Texas Project 345 kV south switchyard electrical bus unexpectedly de-energized. The de-energization of the south bus resulted in a loss of power to Standby Transformer 2 which was supplying power to the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) 4160V busses for the Unit 1 A- and C-Trains and Unit 2 B-Train. Emergency Diesel Generators 11, 13, and 22 automatically started in response to the undervoltage condition, as designed. 

 The cause of this event was a human performance error made by a Transmission and Distribution Service Provider employee during planned relay testing in the switchyard. This event is reportable as an event that resulted in the automatic actuation of the Unit 1 and Unit 2 emergency AC electrical power systems and reactor containment fan coolers, as well as the Unit 2 Auxiliary Feedwater Pump. Planned corrective actions include procedure changes intended to increase oversight of switchyard work activities and assignment of a dedicated Switchyard Coordinator. 

 The event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates and there were no personnel injuries or damage to any safety-related equipment associated with this event. Additionally, all ESF equipment operated as designed. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public.
